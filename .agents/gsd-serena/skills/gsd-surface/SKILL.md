<serena_bridge_skill_adapter>
## A. Runtime Invocation
- This is a vendor-shaped GSD runtime skill installed for Serena bridge use.
- Do not invoke vendor-native skill names from this surface. Use the bridge command when it exists: `gsd-serena-bridge surface --format markdown`.
- If the user request is natural-language or ambiguous, resolve it first with `gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown` and follow the returned packet.
- Treat additional user text as command arguments only after the bridge command, resolver packet, or generated command Markdown defines how to handle it.

## B. User Questions
- GSD workflows may ask the user questions before writing artifacts. In Serena, ask the user directly in chat and wait for the answer.
- Do not silently choose defaults or write workflow artifacts until the user answers, unless the user explicitly requested non-interactive execution or the bridge packet says defaults are safe.
- Keep questions narrow and tied to the active bridge packet, workflow runbook, or operation plan.

## C. Agent and Task Mapping
- Native `Task(...)` / `Agent(...)` calls map to installed GSD agent contracts under `.agents/gsd-serena/agents/**`, vendor-shaped runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, Serena role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Do not use or mention vendor-native collaboration tool schemas from this installed runtime surface.
- Do not claim native subagent execution unless a real supported runtime executed it. If work is performed inline, report it as a bounded Serena role pass.

## D. Mutation and Validation
- Route mutations through `gsd-serena-bridge`, resolver packets, operation plans, allowed writes, checkpoints, and rollback notes.
- Do not auto-create git commits, branches, worktrees, or workflow artifacts unless the user explicitly requests that git action or the bridge packet authorizes the write.
- Validate with the command output, packet validation command, generated command Markdown, or operation-plan validation before reporting completion.

<objective>
Manage the runtime skill surface without reinstall. Reads/writes `.agents/gsd-serena/.gsd-surface.json`
(sibling to `.agents/gsd-serena/.gsd-profile`) and re-stages the active skills directory in place.
Skill dirs live at `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/`.

Sub-commands: list · status · profile · disable · enable · reset
</objective>

## Sub-command routing

Parse the first token of {{GSD_ARGS}}:

| Token | Action |
|---|---|
| `list` | Show enabled + disabled clusters and skills |
| `status` | Alias for `list` plus token cost summary |
| `profile <name>` | Write `baseProfile` and re-stage |
| `profile <n1>,<n2>` | Composed profiles (comma-separated, no spaces) |
| `disable <cluster>` | Add cluster to `disabledClusters`, re-stage |
| `enable <cluster>` | Remove cluster from `disabledClusters`, re-stage |
| `reset` | Delete `.gsd-surface.json`, return to install-time profile |
| *(none)* | Treat as `list` |

---

## list / status

Load the capability registry and call `listSurface(runtimeConfigDir, manifest, CLUSTERS, registry)` from
`gsd-core/bin/lib/surface.cjs`. The registry is loaded via:
```js
const registry = require('gsd-core/bin/lib/capability-registry.cjs');
```
Display:

```
Enabled (N skills, ~T tokens):
  core_loop:   new-project  discuss-phase  plan-phase  execute-phase  help  update
  audit_review: …
  …

Disabled:
  utility:  health  stats  settings  …

Token cost: ~T (budget cap ~500 tokens for 200k context @ 1%)
```

For `status` also append:

```
Base profile:   standard  (from .gsd-surface.json)
Install profile: standard  (from .gsd-profile)
```

---

## profile \<name\>

1. Read current surface: `readSurface(runtimeConfigDir)` → if null, seed from `readActiveProfile(runtimeConfigDir)`.
2. Set `surfaceState.baseProfile = name`.
3. `writeSurface(runtimeConfigDir, surfaceState)`.
4. Resolve and re-apply:
   ```js
   const registry = require('gsd-core/bin/lib/capability-registry.cjs');
   const layout = resolveRuntimeArtifactLayout(runtime, runtimeConfigDir, scope);
   applySurface(runtimeConfigDir, layout, manifest, CLUSTERS, registry);
   ```
5. Confirm: "Surface updated to profile `<name>`. N skills enabled."

---

## disable \<cluster\>

Valid cluster names: `core_loop`, `audit_review`, `milestone`, `research_ideate`,
`workspace_state`, `docs`, `ui`, `ai_eval`, `ns_meta`, `utility`.

1. Validate cluster name against `Object.keys(CLUSTERS)`.
2. Read or initialize surface state.
3. Add cluster to `surfaceState.disabledClusters` (deduplicate).
4. `writeSurface` → resolve layout → `applySurface`:
   ```js
   const registry = require('gsd-core/bin/lib/capability-registry.cjs');
   const layout = resolveRuntimeArtifactLayout(runtime, runtimeConfigDir, scope);
   applySurface(runtimeConfigDir, layout, manifest, CLUSTERS, registry);
   ```
5. Confirm: "Disabled cluster `<cluster>`. N skills removed from surface."

---

## enable \<cluster\>

1. Read surface state; if null, nothing to enable — print "No surface delta active."
2. Remove cluster from `surfaceState.disabledClusters`.
3. `writeSurface` → resolve layout → `applySurface`:
   ```js
   const registry = require('gsd-core/bin/lib/capability-registry.cjs');
   const layout = resolveRuntimeArtifactLayout(runtime, runtimeConfigDir, scope);
   applySurface(runtimeConfigDir, layout, manifest, CLUSTERS, registry);
   ```
4. Confirm: "Enabled cluster `<cluster>`. N skills added back to surface."

---

## reset

1. Check if `.gsd-surface.json` exists.
2. Delete it.
3. Re-apply using only `readActiveProfile(runtimeConfigDir)` (install-time profile).
4. Confirm: "Surface reset to install-time profile `<name>`."

---

## runtimeConfigDir resolution

The `runtimeConfigDir` for `applySurface` is the **base the agent config directory**
(`.agents/gsd-serena`), NOT the skills sub-directory (`.agents/gsd-serena/skills`).

This matches `installRuntimeArtifacts` and `uninstallRuntimeArtifacts`, which also
receive `.agents/gsd-serena` as `configDir`. The skill dirs themselves live at
`.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/` because the `claude global` layout has `destSubpath =
'skills'` — they are derived from `configDir`, not the root for it.

```bash
# Claude Code — global install
RUNTIME_CONFIG_DIR="${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.agents/gsd-serena}"
SCOPE="global"

# Artifact destinations are derived from runtime layout
# via resolveRuntimeArtifactLayout(runtime, RUNTIME_CONFIG_DIR, SCOPE)
# then applySurface(RUNTIME_CONFIG_DIR, layout, manifest, CLUSTERS)
```

Surface state is stored at `${RUNTIME_CONFIG_DIR}/.gsd-surface.json`
(i.e. `.agents/gsd-serena/.gsd-surface.json`).

All paths can be overridden by reading the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` env var if set.

## Error handling

- Unknown cluster name → list valid cluster names, exit without writing.
- Unknown profile name → list known profiles (`core`, `standard`, `full`), exit.
- Missing `surface.cjs` → prompt: "Run `npm i -g gsd-core` to reinstall GSD."
