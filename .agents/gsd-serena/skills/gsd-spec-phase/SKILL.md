## A. Runtime Invocation
- This is a vendor-shaped GSD runtime skill installed for Serena bridge use.
- Do not invoke vendor-native skill names from this surface. Use the bridge command when it exists: `gsd-serena-bridge spec-phase --format markdown`.
- If the user request is natural-language or ambiguous, resolve it first with `gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown` and follow the returned packet.
- Treat additional user text as command arguments only after the bridge command, resolver packet, or generated command Markdown defines how to handle it.

## B. User Questions
- GSD workflows may ask the user questions before writing artifacts. In Serena, ask the user directly in chat and wait for the answer.
- Do not silently choose defaults or write workflow artifacts until the user answers, unless the user explicitly requested non-interactive execution or the bridge packet says defaults are safe.
- Keep questions narrow and tied to the active bridge packet, workflow runbook, or operation plan.

## C. Agent and Task Mapping
- Native `Task(...)` / `Agent(...)` calls map to installed GSD agent contracts under `.agents/gsd-serena/agents/**`, vendor-shaped runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, Serena role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Do not use or mention vendor-native collaboration tool schemas from this installed runtime surface.
- Do not claim native subagent execution unless a real supported runtime executed it. If work is performed inline, report it as a bounded Serena role pass.

## D. Mutation and Validation
- Route mutations through `gsd-serena-bridge`, resolver packets, operation plans, allowed writes, checkpoints, and rollback notes.
- Do not auto-create git commits, branches, worktrees, or workflow artifacts unless the user explicitly requests that git action or the bridge packet authorizes the write.
- Validate with the command output, packet validation command, generated command Markdown, or operation-plan validation before reporting completion.

<objective>
Clarify phase requirements through structured Socratic questioning with quantitative ambiguity scoring.

**Position in workflow:** `spec-phase → discuss-phase → plan-phase → execute-phase → verify`

**How it works:**
1. Load phase context (PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md)
2. Scout the codebase — understand current state before asking questions
3. Run Socratic interview loop (up to 6 rounds, rotating perspectives)
4. Score ambiguity across 4 weighted dimensions after each round
5. Gate: ambiguity ≤ 0.20 AND all dimensions meet minimums → write SPEC.md
6. Commit SPEC.md — discuss-phase picks it up automatically on next run

**Output:** `{phase_dir}/{padded_phase}-SPEC.md` — falsifiable requirements that lock "what/why" before discuss-phase handles "how"
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.agents/gsd-serena/gsd-core/workflows/spec-phase.md
@.agents/gsd-serena/gsd-core/templates/spec.md
</execution_context>

<runtime_note>
**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `AskUserQuestion`. They are equivalent.
</runtime_note>

<context>
Phase number: {{GSD_ARGS}} (required)

**Flags:**
- `--auto` — Skip interactive questions; the agent selects recommended defaults and writes SPEC.md
- `--text` — Use plain-text numbered lists instead of TUI menus (required for `/rc` remote sessions)

Context files are resolved in-workflow using `init phase-op`.
</context>

<process>
Execute end-to-end.

**MANDATORY:** Read the workflow file BEFORE taking any action. The workflow contains the complete step-by-step process including the Socratic interview loop, ambiguity scoring gate, and SPEC.md generation. Do not improvise from the objective summary above.
</process>

<success_criteria>
- Codebase scouted for current state before questioning begins
- All 4 ambiguity dimensions scored after each interview round
- Gate passed: ambiguity ≤ 0.20 AND all dimension minimums met
- SPEC.md written with falsifiable requirements, explicit boundaries, and acceptance criteria
- SPEC.md committed atomically
- User knows they can now run gsd-serena-bridge discuss-phase --format markdown which will load SPEC.md automatically
</success_criteria>
