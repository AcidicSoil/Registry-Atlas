## A. Runtime Invocation
- This is a vendor-shaped GSD runtime skill installed for Serena bridge use.
- Do not invoke vendor-native skill names from this surface. Use the bridge command when it exists: `gsd-serena-bridge forensics --format markdown`.
- If the user request is natural-language or ambiguous, resolve it first with `gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown` and follow the returned packet.
- Treat additional user text as command arguments only after the bridge command, resolver packet, or generated command Markdown defines how to handle it.

## B. User Questions
- GSD workflows may ask the user questions before writing artifacts. In Serena, ask the user directly in chat and wait for the answer.
- Do not silently choose defaults or write workflow artifacts until the user answers, unless the user explicitly requested non-interactive execution or the bridge packet says defaults are safe.
- Keep questions narrow and tied to the active bridge packet, workflow runbook, or operation plan.

## C. Agent and Task Mapping
- Native `Task(...)` / `Agent(...)` calls map to installed GSD agent contracts under `.agents/gsd-serena/agents/**`, vendor-shaped runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, Serena role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Do not use or mention vendor-native collaboration tool schemas from this installed runtime surface.
- Do not claim native subagent execution unless a real supported runtime executed it. If work is performed inline, report it as a bounded Serena role pass.

## D. Mutation and Validation
- Route mutations through `gsd-serena-bridge`, resolver packets, operation plans, allowed writes, checkpoints, and rollback notes.
- Do not auto-create git commits, branches, worktrees, or workflow artifacts unless the user explicitly requests that git action or the bridge packet authorizes the write.
- Validate with the command output, packet validation command, generated command Markdown, or operation-plan validation before reporting completion.

<objective>
Investigate what went wrong during a GSD workflow execution. Analyzes git history, `.planning/` artifacts, and file system state to detect anomalies and generate a structured diagnostic report.

Purpose: Diagnose failed or stuck workflows so the user can understand root cause and take corrective action.
Output: Forensic report saved to `.planning/forensics/`, presented inline, with optional issue creation.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.agents/gsd-serena/gsd-core/workflows/forensics.md
</execution_context>

<context>
**Data sources:**
- `git log` (recent commits, patterns, time gaps)
- `git status` / `git diff` (uncommitted work, conflicts)
- `.planning/STATE.md` (current position, session history)
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` (phase scope and progress)
- `.planning/phases/*/` (PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, VERIFICATION.md, CONTEXT.md)
- `.planning/reports/SESSION_REPORT.md` (last session outcomes)

**User input:**
- Problem description: {{GSD_ARGS}} (optional — will ask if not provided)
</context>

<process>
Execute end-to-end.
</process>

<success_criteria>
- Evidence gathered from all available data sources
- At least 4 anomaly types checked (stuck loop, missing artifacts, abandoned work, crash/interruption)
- Structured forensic report written to `.planning/forensics/report-{timestamp}.md`
- Report presented inline with findings, anomalies, and recommendations
- Interactive investigation offered for deeper analysis
- GitHub issue creation offered if actionable findings exist
</success_criteria>

<critical_rules>
- **Read-only investigation:** Do not modify project source files during forensics. Only write the forensic report and update STATE.md session tracking.
- **Redact sensitive data:** Strip absolute paths, API keys, tokens from reports and issues.
- **Ground findings in evidence:** Every anomaly must cite specific commits, files, or state data.
- **No speculation without evidence:** If data is insufficient, say so — do not fabricate root causes.
</critical_rules>
