## A. Runtime Invocation
- This is a vendor-shaped GSD runtime skill installed for Serena bridge use.
- Do not invoke vendor-native skill names from this surface. Use the bridge command when it exists: `gsd-serena-bridge debug --format markdown`.
- If the user request is natural-language or ambiguous, resolve it first with `gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown` and follow the returned packet.
- Treat additional user text as command arguments only after the bridge command, resolver packet, or generated command Markdown defines how to handle it.

## B. User Questions
- GSD workflows may ask the user questions before writing artifacts. In Serena, ask the user directly in chat and wait for the answer.
- Do not silently choose defaults or write workflow artifacts until the user answers, unless the user explicitly requested non-interactive execution or the bridge packet says defaults are safe.
- Keep questions narrow and tied to the active bridge packet, workflow runbook, or operation plan.

## C. Agent and Task Mapping
- Native `Task(...)` / `Agent(...)` calls map to installed GSD agent contracts under `.agents/gsd-serena/agents/**`, vendor-shaped runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, Serena role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Do not use or mention vendor-native collaboration tool schemas from this installed runtime surface.
- Do not claim native subagent execution unless a real supported runtime executed it. If work is performed inline, report it as a bounded Serena role pass.

## D. Mutation and Validation
- Route mutations through `gsd-serena-bridge`, resolver packets, operation plans, allowed writes, checkpoints, and rollback notes.
- Do not auto-create git commits, branches, worktrees, or workflow artifacts unless the user explicitly requests that git action or the bridge packet authorizes the write.
- Validate with the command output, packet validation command, generated command Markdown, or operation-plan validation before reporting completion.

<objective>
Debug issues using scientific method with subagent isolation.

**Orchestrator role:** Gather symptoms, spawn gsd-debugger agent, handle checkpoints, spawn continuations.

**Flags:**
- `--diagnose` — Diagnose only. Returns a Root Cause Report without applying a fix.

**Subcommands:** `list` · `status <slug>` · `continue <slug>`
</objective>

<available_agent_types>
Valid GSD subagent types (use exact names — do not fall back to 'general-purpose'):
- gsd-debug-session-manager — manages debug checkpoint/continuation loop in isolated context
- gsd-debugger — investigates bugs using scientific method
</available_agent_types>

<execution_context>

</execution_context>

<context>
User's input: {{GSD_ARGS}}

Parse subcommands and flags from {{GSD_ARGS}} BEFORE the active-session check:
- If {{GSD_ARGS}} starts with "list": SUBCMD=list, no further args
- If {{GSD_ARGS}} starts with "status ": SUBCMD=status, SLUG=remainder (trim whitespace)
- If {{GSD_ARGS}} starts with "continue ": SUBCMD=continue, SLUG=remainder (trim whitespace)
- If {{GSD_ARGS}} contains `--diagnose`: SUBCMD=debug, diagnose_only=true, strip `--diagnose` from description
- Otherwise: SUBCMD=debug, diagnose_only=false

Check for active sessions (used for non-list/status/continue flows):
```bash
ls .planning/debug/*.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v resolved | head -5
```
</context>

<process>
Execute end-to-end.
