## A. Runtime Invocation
- This is a vendor-shaped GSD runtime skill installed for Serena bridge use.
- Do not invoke vendor-native skill names from this surface. Use the bridge command when it exists: `gsd-serena-bridge health --format markdown`.
- If the user request is natural-language or ambiguous, resolve it first with `gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown` and follow the returned packet.
- Treat additional user text as command arguments only after the bridge command, resolver packet, or generated command Markdown defines how to handle it.

## B. User Questions
- GSD workflows may ask the user questions before writing artifacts. In Serena, ask the user directly in chat and wait for the answer.
- Do not silently choose defaults or write workflow artifacts until the user answers, unless the user explicitly requested non-interactive execution or the bridge packet says defaults are safe.
- Keep questions narrow and tied to the active bridge packet, workflow runbook, or operation plan.

## C. Agent and Task Mapping
- Native `Task(...)` / `Agent(...)` calls map to installed GSD agent contracts under `.agents/gsd-serena/agents/**`, vendor-shaped runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, Serena role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Do not use or mention vendor-native collaboration tool schemas from this installed runtime surface.
- Do not claim native subagent execution unless a real supported runtime executed it. If work is performed inline, report it as a bounded Serena role pass.

## D. Mutation and Validation
- Route mutations through `gsd-serena-bridge`, resolver packets, operation plans, allowed writes, checkpoints, and rollback notes.
- Do not auto-create git commits, branches, worktrees, or workflow artifacts unless the user explicitly requests that git action or the bridge packet authorizes the write.
- Validate with the command output, packet validation command, generated command Markdown, or operation-plan validation before reporting completion.

<objective>
Validate `.planning/` directory integrity and report actionable issues. Checks for missing files, invalid configurations, inconsistent state, and orphaned plans.

`--context` runs an orthogonal check: the running session's context utilization. The workflow asks for the model's tokensUsed + contextWindow, calls `node "$HOME/.agents/gsd-serena/gsd-core/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" query validate.context`, and renders one of three states:

| Utilization | State    | Action                                                |
|-------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| < 60%       | healthy  | no action — context is comfortable                    |
| 60% – 70%   | warning  | recommend `gsd-serena-bridge thread --format markdown` to start fresh                |
| ≥ 70%       | critical | reasoning quality may degrade past the fracture point |
