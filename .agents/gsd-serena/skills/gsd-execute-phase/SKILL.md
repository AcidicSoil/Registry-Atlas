<serena_bridge_skill_adapter>
## A. Runtime Invocation
- This is a vendor-shaped GSD runtime skill installed for Serena bridge use.
- Do not invoke vendor-native skill names from this surface. Use the bridge command when it exists: `gsd-serena-bridge execute-phase --format markdown`.
- If the user request is natural-language or ambiguous, resolve it first with `gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown` and follow the returned packet.
- Treat additional user text as command arguments only after the bridge command, resolver packet, or generated command Markdown defines how to handle it.

## B. User Questions
- GSD workflows may ask the user questions before writing artifacts. In Serena, ask the user directly in chat and wait for the answer.
- Do not silently choose defaults or write workflow artifacts until the user answers, unless the user explicitly requested non-interactive execution or the bridge packet says defaults are safe.
- Keep questions narrow and tied to the active bridge packet, workflow runbook, or operation plan.

## C. Agent and Task Mapping
- Native `Task(...)` / `Agent(...)` calls map to installed GSD agent contracts under `.agents/gsd-serena/agents/**`, vendor-shaped runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, Serena role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Do not use or mention vendor-native collaboration tool schemas from this installed runtime surface.
- Do not claim native subagent execution unless a real supported runtime executed it. If work is performed inline, report it as a bounded Serena role pass.

## D. Mutation and Validation
- Route mutations through `gsd-serena-bridge`, resolver packets, operation plans, allowed writes, checkpoints, and rollback notes.
- Do not auto-create git commits, branches, worktrees, or workflow artifacts unless the user explicitly requests that git action or the bridge packet authorizes the write.
- Validate with the command output, packet validation command, generated command Markdown, or operation-plan validation before reporting completion.

<objective>
Execute all plans in a phase using wave-based parallel execution.

Orchestrator stays lean: discover plans, analyze dependencies, group into waves, spawn subagents, collect results. Each subagent loads the full execute-plan context and handles its own plan.

Optional wave filter:
- `--wave N` executes only Wave `N` for pacing, quota management, or staged rollout
- phase verification/completion still only happens when no incomplete plans remain after the selected wave finishes

Flag handling rule:
- The optional flags documented below are available behaviors, not implied active behaviors
- A flag is active only when its literal token appears in `{{GSD_ARGS}}`
- If a documented flag is absent from `{{GSD_ARGS}}`, treat it as inactive

Context budget: ~15% orchestrator, 100% fresh per subagent.

<runtime_note>
**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `AskUserQuestion`. They are equivalent — `vscode_askquestions` is the VS Code Copilot implementation of the same interactive question API.

<context>
Phase: {{GSD_ARGS}}

**Available optional flags (documentation only — not automatically active):**
- `--wave N` — Execute only Wave `N` in the phase. Use when you want to pace execution or stay inside usage limits.
- `--gaps-only` — Execute only gap closure plans (plans with `gap_closure: true` in frontmatter). Use after verify-work creates fix plans.
- `--interactive` — Execute plans sequentially inline (no subagents) with user checkpoints between tasks. Lower token usage, pair-programming style. Best for small phases, bug fixes, and verification gaps.

**Active flags must be derived from `{{GSD_ARGS}}`:**
- `--wave N` is active only if the literal `--wave` token is present in `{{GSD_ARGS}}`
- `--gaps-only` is active only if the literal `--gaps-only` token is present in `{{GSD_ARGS}}`
- `--interactive` is active only if the literal `--interactive` token is present in `{{GSD_ARGS}}`
- If none of these tokens appear, run the standard full-phase execution flow with no flag-specific filtering
- Do not infer that a flag is active just because it is documented in this prompt

Context files are resolved inside the workflow via `node "$HOME/.agents/gsd-serena/gsd-core/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" query init.execute-phase` and per-subagent `<files_to_read>` blocks.

Execute end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (wave execution, checkpoint handling, verification, state updates, routing).
