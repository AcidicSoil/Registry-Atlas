## A. Runtime Invocation
- This is a vendor-shaped GSD runtime skill installed for Serena bridge use.
- Do not invoke vendor-native skill names from this surface. Use the bridge command when it exists: `gsd-serena-bridge plan-phase --format markdown`.
- If the user request is natural-language or ambiguous, resolve it first with `gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown` and follow the returned packet.
- Treat additional user text as command arguments only after the bridge command, resolver packet, or generated command Markdown defines how to handle it.

## B. User Questions
- GSD workflows may ask the user questions before writing artifacts. In Serena, ask the user directly in chat and wait for the answer.
- Do not silently choose defaults or write workflow artifacts until the user answers, unless the user explicitly requested non-interactive execution or the bridge packet says defaults are safe.
- Keep questions narrow and tied to the active bridge packet, workflow runbook, or operation plan.

## C. Agent and Task Mapping
- Native `Task(...)` / `Agent(...)` calls map to installed GSD agent contracts under `.agents/gsd-serena/agents/**`, vendor-shaped runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, Serena role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Do not use or mention vendor-native collaboration tool schemas from this installed runtime surface.
- Do not claim native subagent execution unless a real supported runtime executed it. If work is performed inline, report it as a bounded Serena role pass.

## D. Mutation and Validation
- Route mutations through `gsd-serena-bridge`, resolver packets, operation plans, allowed writes, checkpoints, and rollback notes.
- Do not auto-create git commits, branches, worktrees, or workflow artifacts unless the user explicitly requests that git action or the bridge packet authorizes the write.
- Validate with the command output, packet validation command, generated command Markdown, or operation-plan validation before reporting completion.

<objective>
Create executable phase prompts (PLAN.md files) for a roadmap phase with integrated research and verification.

**Default flow:** Research (if needed) → Plan → Verify → Done

**Research-only mode (`--research-phase <N>`):** Spawn `gsd-phase-researcher` for phase `N`, write `RESEARCH.md`, then exit before the planner runs. Useful for cross-phase research, doc review before committing to a planning approach, and correction-without-replanning loops where iterating on research alone is dramatically cheaper than re-spawning the planner. Replaces the deleted research-phase command (#3042).

**Research-only modifiers:**
- **No flag** — when `RESEARCH.md` already exists, auto-uses it: emits a one-line notice and exits cleanly, no prompt.
- **`--research`** — force-refresh: re-spawn the researcher unconditionally, no prompt. Bypasses the existing-RESEARCH.md auto-use path.
- **`--view`** — view-only: print existing `RESEARCH.md` to stdout. Does not spawn the researcher. Cheapest mode for the correction-without-replanning loop. If no `RESEARCH.md` exists yet, errors with a hint to drop `--view`.

**Orchestrator role:** Parse arguments, validate phase, research domain (unless skipped), spawn gsd-planner, verify with gsd-plan-checker, iterate until pass or max iterations, present results.

<runtime_note>
**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `AskUserQuestion`. They are equivalent — `vscode_askquestions` is the VS Code Copilot implementation of the same interactive question API. Do not skip questioning steps because `AskUserQuestion` appears unavailable; use `vscode_askquestions` instead.

<context>
Phase number: {{GSD_ARGS}} (optional — auto-detects next unplanned phase if omitted)

**Flags:**
- `--research` — Force re-research even if RESEARCH.md exists
- `--skip-research` — Skip research, go straight to planning
- `--gaps` — Gap closure mode (reads VERIFICATION.md, skips research)
- `--skip-verify` — Skip verification loop
- `--prd <file>` — Use a PRD/acceptance criteria file instead of discuss-phase. Parses requirements into CONTEXT.md automatically. Skips discuss-phase entirely.
- `--ingest <path-or-glob>` — Use one or more ADR files instead of discuss-phase. Parses locked decisions + scope fences into CONTEXT.md automatically. Skips discuss-phase entirely.
- `--ingest-format <auto|nygard|madr|narrative>` — Optional ADR parser format override (`auto` default).
- `--reviews` — Replan incorporating cross-AI review feedback from REVIEWS.md (produced by `gsd-serena-bridge review --format markdown`)
- `--text` — Use plain-text numbered lists instead of TUI menus (required for `/rc` remote sessions)
- `--mvp` — Vertical MVP mode. Planner organizes tasks as feature slices (UI→API→DB) instead of horizontal layers. On Phase 1 of a new project, also emits `SKELETON.md` (Walking Skeleton). Can be persisted on a phase via `**Mode:** mvp` in ROADMAP.md.

Normalize phase input in step 2 before any directory lookups.
