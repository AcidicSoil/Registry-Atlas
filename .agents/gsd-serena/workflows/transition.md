# Bridge Workflow: transition

<!-- generated-by: pnpm gen:bridge-commands -->

## Purpose

This bridge workflow runbook translates the actual GSD-core workflow information and adapts it for Serena bridge operation. Read it when operating `gsd-workflow-transition` in a target project.

## Bridge Entry

```bash
gsd-serena-bridge bootstrap --format markdown
gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
```

If setup is stale or broken, run:

```bash
gsd-serena-bridge repair --format markdown
gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
```

Primary bridge route:

```text
Use `gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown` to map this workflow intent to an implemented bridge command or operation plan.
```

For natural-language requests, classify first:

```bash
cat <<'EOF_REQUEST' | gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown
<verbatim user request>
EOF_REQUEST
```

## Bridge Substitution Rules

- Preserve the GSD-core trigger, purpose, process steps, decision logic, and quality bar from the source workflow below.
- Replace native `/gsd:*` slash commands with `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown` when implemented.
- Replace native `gsd_run query ...` calls with bridge commands, resolver packets, installed contracts, or explicit operation plans.
- Replace native `Agent(...)` dispatch with Serena role workflows, generated role skills, sequential role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Do not run native shell snippets that mutate state unless a bridge command or operation plan authorizes the same write set and validation.
- Do not claim exact native behavior for adapted-safe or planned rows. Name the bridge substitute and remaining gap.

## Source Evidence

- Contract ID: `gsd-workflow-transition`
- Status: `planned`
- Source path: `gsd-core/workflows/transition.md`
- Resolved source path: `vendor/reference/gsd-core/gsd-core/workflows/transition.md`
- Mirrored runbook path: `.agents/gsd-serena/workflows/transition.md`

## Translated GSD Workflow

### Native Shim Translation
- Native GSD shim locator omitted: the bridge uses the installed `gsd-serena-bridge` CLI, `bootstrap`, `doctor`, `repair`, resolver packets, and install-managed project surfaces instead of locating `gsd-tools.cjs`.
<internal_workflow>

**This is an INTERNAL workflow — NOT a user-facing command.**

There is no `/gsd-transition` command. This workflow is invoked automatically by
`execute-phase` during auto-advance, or inline by the orchestrator after phase
verification. Users should never be told to run `/gsd-transition`.

**Valid user commands for phase progression:**
- ``gsd-serena-bridge discuss-phase --format markdown` {N}` — discuss a phase before planning
- ``gsd-serena-bridge plan-phase --format markdown` {N}` — plan a phase
- ``gsd-serena-bridge execute-phase --format markdown` {N}` — execute a phase
- ``gsd-serena-bridge progress --format markdown`` — see roadmap progress

</internal_workflow>

<required_reading>

**Read these files NOW:**

1. `.planning/STATE.md`
2. `.planning/PROJECT.md`
3. `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
4. Current phase's plan files (`*-PLAN.md`)
5. Current phase's summary files (`*-SUMMARY.md`)

</required_reading>

<purpose>

Mark current phase complete and advance to next. This is the natural point where progress tracking and PROJECT.md evolution happen.

"Planning next phase" = "current phase is done"

</purpose>

<process>

<step name="load_project_state" priority="first">

Before transition, read project state:

```bash
cat .planning/STATE.md 2>/dev/null || true
cat .planning/PROJECT.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

Parse current position to verify we're transitioning the right phase.
Note accumulated context that may need updating after transition.

</step>

<step name="verify_completion">

Check current phase has all plan summaries:

```bash
(ls .planning/phases/XX-current/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null || true) | sort
(ls .planning/phases/XX-current/*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null || true) | sort
```

**Verification logic:**

- Count PLAN files
- Count SUMMARY files
- If counts match: all plans complete
- If counts don't match: incomplete

<config-check>

```bash
cat .planning/config.json 2>/dev/null || true
```

</config-check>

**Check for verification debt in this phase:**

```bash
# Count outstanding items in current phase
OUTSTANDING=""
for f in .planning/phases/XX-current/*-UAT.md .planning/phases/XX-current/*-VERIFICATION.md; do
[ -f "$f" ] || continue
grep -q "result: pending\|result: blocked\|status: partial\|status: human_needed\|status: diagnosed" "$f" && OUTSTANDING="$OUTSTANDING\n$(basename $f)"
done
```

**If OUTSTANDING is not empty:**

Append to the completion confirmation message (regardless of mode):

```
Outstanding verification items in this phase:
{list filenames}

These will carry forward as debt. Review: ``gsd-serena-bridge audit-uat --format markdown``
```

This does NOT block transition — it ensures the user sees the debt before confirming.

**If all plans complete:**

<if mode="yolo">

```
⚡ Auto-approved: Transition Phase [X] → Phase [X+1]
Phase [X] complete — all [Y] plans finished.

Proceeding to mark done and advance...
```

Proceed directly to cleanup_handoff step.

</if>

<if mode="interactive" OR="custom with gates.confirm_transition true">

Ask: "Phase [X] complete — all [Y] plans finished. Ready to mark done and move to Phase [X+1]?"

Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

</if>

**If plans incomplete:**

**SAFETY RAIL: always_confirm_destructive applies here.**
Skipping incomplete plans is destructive — ALWAYS prompt regardless of mode.

Present:

```
Phase [X] has incomplete plans:
- {phase}-01-SUMMARY.md ✓ Complete
- {phase}-02-SUMMARY.md ✗ Missing
- {phase}-03-SUMMARY.md ✗ Missing

⚠️ Safety rail: Skipping plans requires confirmation (destructive action)

Options:
1. Continue current phase (execute remaining plans)
2. Mark complete anyway (skip remaining plans)
3. Review what's left
```

Wait for user decision.

</step>

<step name="cleanup_handoff">

Check for lingering handoffs:

```bash
ls .planning/phases/XX-current/.continue-here*.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

If found, delete them — phase is complete, handoffs are stale.

</step>

<step name="update_roadmap_and_state">

**Delegate ROADMAP.md and STATE.md updates to `gsd-tools.cjs query phase.complete`:**

```bash
- Native query translated: `TRANSITION=$(gsd_run query phase.complete "${current_phase}")` -> use the closest `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown`, resolver packet, installed contract, or explicit operation-plan step with validation.
```

The CLI handles:
- Marking the phase checkbox as `[x]` complete with today's date
- Updating plan count to final (e.g., "3/3 plans complete")
- Updating the Progress table (Status → Complete, adding date)
- Advancing STATE.md to next phase (Current Phase, Status → Ready to plan, Current Plan → Not started)
- Detecting if this is the last phase in the milestone

Extract from result: `completed_phase`, `plans_executed`, `next_phase`, `next_phase_name`, `is_last_phase`.

</step>

<step name="archive_prompts">

If prompts were generated for the phase, they stay in place.
The `completed/` subfolder pattern from create-meta-prompts handles archival.

</step>

<step name="evolve_project">

Evolve PROJECT.md to reflect learnings from completed phase.

**Read phase summaries:**

```bash
cat .planning/phases/XX-current/*-SUMMARY.md
```

**Assess requirement changes:**

1. **Requirements validated?**
- Any Active requirements shipped in this phase?
- Move to Validated with phase reference: `- ✓ [Requirement] — Phase X`

2. **Requirements invalidated?**
- Any Active requirements discovered to be unnecessary or wrong?
- Move to Out of Scope with reason: `- [Requirement] — [why invalidated]`

3. **Requirements emerged?**
- Any new requirements discovered during building?
- Add to Active: `- [ ] [New requirement]`

4. **Decisions to log?**
- Extract decisions from SUMMARY.md files
- Add to Key Decisions table with outcome if known

5. **"What This Is" still accurate?**
- If the product has meaningfully changed, update the description
- Keep it current and accurate

**Update PROJECT.md:**

Make the edits inline. Update "Last updated" footer:

```markdown
---
*Last updated: [date] after Phase [X]*
```

**Example evolution:**

Before:

```markdown
### Active

- [ ] JWT authentication
- [ ] Real-time sync < 500ms
- [ ] Offline mode

### Out of Scope

- OAuth2 — complexity not needed for v1
```

After (Phase 2 shipped JWT auth, discovered rate limiting needed):

```markdown
### Validated

- ✓ JWT authentication — Phase 2

### Active

- [ ] Real-time sync < 500ms
- [ ] Offline mode
- [ ] Rate limiting on sync endpoint

### Out of Scope

- OAuth2 — complexity not needed for v1
```

**Step complete when:**

- [ ] Phase summaries reviewed for learnings
- [ ] Validated requirements moved from Active
- [ ] Invalidated requirements moved to Out of Scope with reason
- [ ] Emerged requirements added to Active
- [ ] New decisions logged with rationale
- [ ] "What This Is" updated if product changed
- [ ] "Last updated" footer reflects this transition

</step>

<step name="graduation_scan">

Scan LEARNINGS.md files from recent phases for recurring patterns and surface promotion candidates to the developer.

**Invoke the graduation helper:**

```text
- GSD-core workflow import retained: `@~/.claude/gsd-core/workflows/graduation.md`. Use the mirrored bridge workflow runbook under `.agents/gsd-serena/workflows/**` for adapted execution.
```

This step is fully delegated to `graduation.md`. It handles guard checks (feature flag, window size, threshold), clustering, backlog filtering, HITL prompting, promotion writes, and STATE.md updates.

**This step is always non-blocking:** graduation candidates are surfaced for the developer's decision; no action is required to continue the transition. If the graduation scan produces no qualifying clusters, it prints a single `[graduation: no qualifying c...

**Step complete when:**

- [ ] graduation.md guard checks passed (or skipped with silent no-op)
- [ ] Recurring clusters surfaced (or `[graduation: no qualifying clusters]` printed)
- [ ] Each cluster resolved as Promote / Defer / Dismiss (or all skipped)

</step>

<step name="update_current_position_after_transition">

**Note:** Basic position updates (Current Phase, Status, Current Plan, Last Activity) were already handled by `gsd-tools.cjs query phase.complete` in the update_roadmap_and_state step.

Verify the updates are correct by reading STATE.md. If the progress bar needs updating, use:

```bash
- Native query translated: `PROGRESS=$(gsd_run query progress.bar --raw)` -> use the closest `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown`, resolver packet, installed contract, or explicit operation-plan step with validation.
```

Update the progress bar line in STATE.md with the result.

**Step complete when:**

- [ ] Phase number incremented to next phase (done by phase complete)
- [ ] Plan status reset to "Not started" (done by phase complete)
- [ ] Status shows "Ready to plan" (done by phase complete)
- [ ] Progress bar reflects total completed plans

</step>

<step name="update_project_reference">

Update Project Reference section in STATE.md.

```markdown
## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated [today])

**Core value:** [Current core value from PROJECT.md]
**Current focus:** [Next phase name]
```

Update the date and current focus to reflect the transition.

</step>

<step name="review_accumulated_context">

Review and update Accumulated Context section in STATE.md.

**Decisions:**

- Note recent decisions from this phase (3-5 max)
- Full log lives in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table

**Blockers/Concerns:**

- Source translation truncated here; use the bridge command output, workflow runbook, installed contracts, or operation plan for continuation.
