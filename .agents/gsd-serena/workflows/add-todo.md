# Bridge Workflow: add-todo

<!-- generated-by: pnpm gen:bridge-commands -->

## Purpose

This bridge workflow runbook translates the actual GSD-core workflow information and adapts it for Serena bridge operation. Read it when operating `gsd-workflow-add-todo` in a target project.

## Bridge Entry

```bash
gsd-serena-bridge bootstrap --format markdown
gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
```

If setup is stale or broken, run:

```bash
gsd-serena-bridge repair --format markdown
gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
```

Primary bridge route:

```text
Use `gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown` to map this workflow intent to an implemented bridge command or operation plan.
```

For natural-language requests, classify first:

```bash
cat <<'EOF_REQUEST' | gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown
<verbatim user request>
EOF_REQUEST
```

## Bridge Substitution Rules

- Preserve the GSD-core trigger, purpose, process steps, decision logic, and quality bar from the source workflow below.
- Replace native `/gsd:*` slash commands with `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown` when implemented.
- Replace native `gsd_run query ...` calls with bridge commands, resolver packets, installed contracts, or explicit operation plans.
- Replace native `Agent(...)` dispatch with Serena role workflows, generated role skills, sequential role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Do not run native shell snippets that mutate state unless a bridge command or operation plan authorizes the same write set and validation.
- Do not claim exact native behavior for adapted-safe or planned rows. Name the bridge substitute and remaining gap.

## Source Evidence

- Contract ID: `gsd-workflow-add-todo`
- Status: `planned`
- Source path: `gsd-core/workflows/add-todo.md`
- Resolved source path: `vendor/reference/gsd-core/gsd-core/workflows/add-todo.md`
- Mirrored runbook path: `.agents/gsd-serena/workflows/add-todo.md`

## Translated GSD Workflow

### Native Shim Translation
- Native GSD shim locator omitted: the bridge uses the installed `gsd-serena-bridge` CLI, `bootstrap`, `doctor`, `repair`, resolver packets, and install-managed project surfaces instead of locating `gsd-tools.cjs`.
<purpose>
Capture an idea, task, or issue that surfaces during a GSD session as a structured todo for later work. Enables "thought → capture → continue" flow without losing context.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.
</required_reading>

<process>

<step name="init_context">
Load todo context:

```bash
- Native query translated: `INIT=$(gsd_run query init.todos)` -> use the closest `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown`, resolver packet, installed contract, or explicit operation-plan step with validation.
if [[ "$INIT" == @file:* ]]; then INIT=$(cat "${INIT#@file:}"); fi
```

Extract from init JSON: `commit_docs`, `date`, `timestamp`, `todo_count`, `todos`, `pending_dir`, `todos_dir_exists`.

Ensure directories exist:
```bash
mkdir -p .planning/todos/pending .planning/todos/completed
```

Note existing areas from the todos array for consistency in infer_area step.
</step>

<step name="extract_content">
**With arguments:** Use as the title/focus.
- `/gsd-add-todo Add auth token refresh` → title = "Add auth token refresh"

**Without arguments:** Analyze recent conversation to extract:
- The specific problem, idea, or task discussed
- Relevant file paths mentioned
- Technical details (error messages, line numbers, constraints)

Formulate:
- `title`: 3-10 word descriptive title (action verb preferred)
- `problem`: What's wrong or why this is needed
- `solution`: Approach hints or "TBD" if just an idea
- `files`: Relevant paths with line numbers from conversation
</step>

<step name="infer_area">
Infer area from file paths:

| Path pattern | Area |
|--------------|------|
| `src/api/*`, `api/*` | `api` |
| `src/components/*`, `src/ui/*` | `ui` |
| `src/auth/*`, `auth/*` | `auth` |
| `src/db/*`, `database/*` | `database` |
| `tests/*`, `__tests__/*` | `testing` |
| `docs/*` | `docs` |
| `.planning/*` | `planning` |
| `scripts/*`, `bin/*` | `tooling` |
| No files or unclear | `general` |

Use existing area from step 2 if similar match exists.
</step>

<step name="check_duplicates">
```bash
# Search for key words from title in existing todos
grep -l -i "[key words from title]" .planning/todos/pending/*.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

If potential duplicate found:
1. Read the existing todo
2. Compare scope

**Text mode (`workflow.text_mode: true` in config or `--text` flag):** Set `TEXT_MODE=true` if `--text` is present in `$ARGUMENTS` OR `text_mode` from init JSON is `true`. When TEXT_MODE is active, replace every `AskUserQuestion` call with a plain-text numb...
If overlapping, use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Duplicate?"
- question: "Similar todo exists: [title]. What would you like to do?"
- options:
- "Skip" — keep existing todo
- "Replace" — update existing with new context
- "Add anyway" — create as separate todo
</step>

<step name="create_file">
Use values from init context: `timestamp` and `date` are already available.

Generate slug for the title:
```bash
- Native query translated: `slug=$(gsd_run query generate-slug "$title" --raw)` -> use the closest `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown`, resolver packet, installed contract, or explicit operation-plan step with validation.
```

Write to `.planning/todos/pending/${date}-${slug}.md`:

```markdown
---
created: [timestamp]
title: [title]
area: [area]
files:
- [file:lines]
---

## Problem

[problem description - enough context for future Claude to understand weeks later]

## Solution

[approach hints or "TBD"]
```
</step>

<step name="update_state">
If `.planning/STATE.md` exists:

1. Use `todo_count` from init context (or re-run `init todos` if count changed)
2. Update "### Pending Todos" under "## Accumulated Context"
</step>

<step name="git_commit">
Commit the todo and any updated state:

```bash
- Native commit helper translated: do not auto-commit; only run git commit when the user explicitly asks, after reporting files and validation.
```

Tool respects `commit_docs` config and gitignore automatically.

Confirm: "Committed: docs: capture todo - [title]"
</step>

<step name="confirm">
```
Todo saved: .planning/todos/pending/[filename]

[title]
Area: [area]
Files: [count] referenced

Would you like to:

1. Continue with current work
2. Add another todo
3. View all todos (`gsd-serena-bridge capture --format markdown` --list)
```
</step>
