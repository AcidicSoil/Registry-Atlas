# Bridge Workflow: audit-uat

<!-- generated-by: pnpm gen:bridge-commands -->

## Purpose

This bridge workflow runbook translates the actual GSD-core workflow information and adapts it for Serena bridge operation. Read it when operating `gsd-workflow-audit-uat` in a target project.

## Bridge Entry

```bash
gsd-serena-bridge bootstrap --format markdown
gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
```

If setup is stale or broken, run:

```bash
gsd-serena-bridge repair --format markdown
gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
```

Primary bridge route:

```text
Use `gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown` to map this workflow intent to an implemented bridge command or operation plan.
```

For natural-language requests, classify first:

```bash
cat <<'EOF_REQUEST' | gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown
<verbatim user request>
EOF_REQUEST
```

## Bridge Substitution Rules

- Preserve the GSD-core trigger, purpose, process steps, decision logic, and quality bar from the source workflow below.
- Replace native `/gsd:*` slash commands with `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown` when implemented.
- Replace native `gsd_run query ...` calls with bridge commands, resolver packets, installed contracts, or explicit operation plans.
- Replace native `Agent(...)` dispatch with Serena role workflows, generated role skills, sequential role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Do not run native shell snippets that mutate state unless a bridge command or operation plan authorizes the same write set and validation.
- Do not claim exact native behavior for adapted-safe or planned rows. Name the bridge substitute and remaining gap.

## Source Evidence

- Contract ID: `gsd-workflow-audit-uat`
- Status: `planned`
- Source path: `gsd-core/workflows/audit-uat.md`
- Resolved source path: `vendor/reference/gsd-core/gsd-core/workflows/audit-uat.md`
- Mirrored runbook path: `.agents/gsd-serena/workflows/audit-uat.md`

## Translated GSD Workflow

### Native Shim Translation
- Native GSD shim locator omitted: the bridge uses the installed `gsd-serena-bridge` CLI, `bootstrap`, `doctor`, `repair`, resolver packets, and install-managed project surfaces instead of locating `gsd-tools.cjs`.
<purpose>
Cross-phase audit of all UAT and verification files. Finds every outstanding item (pending, skipped, blocked, human_needed), optionally verifies against the codebase to detect stale docs, and produces a prioritized human test plan.
</purpose>

<process>

<step name="initialize">
Run the CLI audit:

```bash
- Native query translated: `AUDIT=$(gsd_run query audit-uat --raw)` -> use the closest `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown`, resolver packet, installed contract, or explicit operation-plan step with validation.
```

Parse JSON for `results` array and `summary` object.

If `summary.total_items` is 0:
```
## All Clear

No outstanding UAT or verification items found across all phases.
All tests are passing, resolved, or diagnosed with fix plans.
```
Stop here.
</step>

<step name="categorize">
Group items by what's actionable NOW vs. what needs prerequisites:

**Testable Now** (no external dependencies):
- `pending` — tests never run
- `human_uat` — human verification items
- `skipped_unresolved` — skipped without clear blocking reason

**Needs Prerequisites:**
- `server_blocked` — needs external server running
- `device_needed` — needs physical device (not simulator)
- `build_needed` — needs release/preview build
- `third_party` — needs external service configuration

For each item in "Testable Now", use Grep/Read to check if the underlying feature still exists in the codebase:
- If the test references a component/function that no longer exists → mark as `stale`
- If the test references code that has been significantly rewritten → mark as `needs_update`
- Otherwise → mark as `active`
</step>

<step name="present">
Present the audit report:

```
## UAT Audit Report

**{total_items} outstanding items across {total_files} files in {phase_count} phases**

### Testable Now ({count})

| # | Phase | Test | Description | Status |
|---|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | {phase} | {test_name} | {expected} | {active/stale/needs_update} |
...

### Needs Prerequisites ({count})

| # | Phase | Test | Blocked By | Description |
|---|-------|------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | {phase} | {test_name} | {category} | {expected} |
...

### Stale (can be closed) ({count})

| # | Phase | Test | Why Stale |
|---|-------|------|-----------|
| 1 | {phase} | {test_name} | {reason} |
...

---

## Recommended Actions

1. **Close stale items:** ``gsd-serena-bridge verify-work --format markdown` {phase}` — mark stale tests as resolved
2. **Run active tests:** Human UAT test plan below
3. **When prerequisites met:** Retest blocked items with ``gsd-serena-bridge verify-work --format markdown` {phase}`
```
</step>

<step name="test_plan">
Generate a human UAT test plan for "Testable Now" + "active" items only:

Group by what can be tested together (same screen, same feature, same prerequisite):

```
## Human UAT Test Plan

### Group 1: {category — e.g., "Billing Flow"}
Prerequisites: {what needs to be running/configured}

1. **{Test name}** (Phase {N})
- Navigate to: {where}
- Do: {action}
- Expected: {expected behavior}

2. **{Test name}** (Phase {N})
...

### Group 2: {category}
...
```
</step>
