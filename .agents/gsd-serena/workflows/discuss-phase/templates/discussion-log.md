# Bridge Workflow: discuss-phase-templates-discussion-log

<!-- generated-by: pnpm gen:bridge-commands -->

## Purpose

This bridge workflow runbook translates the actual GSD-core workflow information and adapts it for Serena bridge operation. Read it when operating `gsd-workflow-discuss-phase-templates-discussion-log` in a target project.

## Bridge Entry

```bash
gsd-serena-bridge bootstrap --format markdown
gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
```

If setup is stale or broken, run:

```bash
gsd-serena-bridge repair --format markdown
gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
```

Primary bridge route:

```text
Use `gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown` to map this workflow intent to an implemented bridge command or operation plan.
```

For natural-language requests, classify first:

```bash
cat <<'EOF_REQUEST' | gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown
<verbatim user request>
EOF_REQUEST
```

## Bridge Substitution Rules

- Preserve the GSD-core trigger, purpose, process steps, decision logic, and quality bar from the source workflow below.
- Replace native `/gsd:*` slash commands with `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown` when implemented.
- Replace native `gsd_run query ...` calls with bridge commands, resolver packets, installed contracts, or explicit operation plans.
- Replace native `Agent(...)` dispatch with Serena role workflows, generated role skills, sequential role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Do not run native shell snippets that mutate state unless a bridge command or operation plan authorizes the same write set and validation.
- Do not claim exact native behavior for adapted-safe or planned rows. Name the bridge substitute and remaining gap.

## Translated GSD Workflow

# DISCUSSION-LOG.md template — for discuss-phase git_commit step

> **Lazy-loaded.** Read this file only inside the `git_commit` step of
> `workflows/discuss-phase.md`, immediately before writing
> `${phase_dir}/${padded_phase}-DISCUSSION-LOG.md`.

## Purpose

Audit trail for human review (compliance, learning, retrospectives). NOT
consumed by downstream agents — those read CONTEXT.md only.

## Template body

```markdown
# Phase [X]: [Name] - Discussion Log

> **Audit trail only.** Do not use as input to planning, research, or execution agents.
> Decisions are captured in CONTEXT.md — this log preserves the alternatives considered.

**Date:** [ISO date]
**Phase:** [phase number]-[phase name]
**Areas discussed:** [comma-separated list]
