# Bridge Workflow: cleanup

<!-- generated-by: pnpm gen:bridge-commands -->

## Purpose

This bridge workflow runbook translates the actual GSD-core workflow information and adapts it for Serena bridge operation. Read it when operating `gsd-workflow-cleanup` in a target project.

## Bridge Entry

```bash
gsd-serena-bridge bootstrap --format markdown
gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
```

If setup is stale or broken, run:

```bash
gsd-serena-bridge repair --format markdown
gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
```

Primary bridge route:

```text
Use `gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown` to map this workflow intent to an implemented bridge command or operation plan.
```

For natural-language requests, classify first:

```bash
cat <<'EOF_REQUEST' | gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown
<verbatim user request>
EOF_REQUEST
```

## Bridge Substitution Rules

- Preserve the GSD-core trigger, purpose, process steps, decision logic, and quality bar from the source workflow below.
- Replace native `/gsd:*` slash commands with `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown` when implemented.
- Replace native `gsd_run query ...` calls with bridge commands, resolver packets, installed contracts, or explicit operation plans.
- Replace native `Agent(...)` dispatch with Serena role workflows, generated role skills, sequential role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Do not run native shell snippets that mutate state unless a bridge command or operation plan authorizes the same write set and validation.
- Do not claim exact native behavior for adapted-safe or planned rows. Name the bridge substitute and remaining gap.

## Source Evidence

- Contract ID: `gsd-workflow-cleanup`
- Status: `planned`
- Source path: `gsd-core/workflows/cleanup.md`
- Resolved source path: `vendor/reference/gsd-core/gsd-core/workflows/cleanup.md`
- Mirrored runbook path: `.agents/gsd-serena/workflows/cleanup.md`

## Translated GSD Workflow

### Native Shim Translation
- Native GSD shim locator omitted: the bridge uses the installed `gsd-serena-bridge` CLI, `bootstrap`, `doctor`, `repair`, resolver packets, and install-managed project surfaces instead of locating `gsd-tools.cjs`.
<purpose>

Archive accumulated phase directories from completed milestones into `.planning/milestones/v{X.Y}-phases/`. Identifies which phases belong to each completed milestone, shows a dry-run summary, and moves directories on confirmation.

</purpose>

<required_reading>

1. `.planning/MILESTONES.md`
2. `.planning/milestones/` directory listing
3. `.planning/phases/` directory listing

</required_reading>

<process>

<step name="identify_completed_milestones">

Read `.planning/MILESTONES.md` to identify completed milestones and their versions.

```bash
cat .planning/MILESTONES.md
```

Extract each milestone version (e.g., v1.0, v1.1, v2.0).

Check which milestone archive dirs already exist:

```bash
ls -d .planning/milestones/v*-phases 2>/dev/null || true
```

Filter to milestones that do NOT already have a `-phases` archive directory.

If all milestones already have phase archives:

```
All completed milestones already have phase directories archived. Nothing to clean up.
```

Stop here.

</step>

<step name="determine_phase_membership">

For each completed milestone without a `-phases` archive, read the archived ROADMAP snapshot to determine which phases belong to it:

```bash
cat .planning/milestones/v{X.Y}-ROADMAP.md
```

Extract phase numbers and names from the archived roadmap (e.g., Phase 1: Foundation, Phase 2: Auth).

Check which of those phase directories still exist in `.planning/phases/`:

```bash
ls -d .planning/phases/*/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

Match phase directories to milestone membership. Only include directories that still exist in `.planning/phases/`.

</step>

<step name="show_dry_run">

Present a dry-run summary for each milestone:

```
## Cleanup Summary

### v{X.Y} — {Milestone Name}
These phase directories will be archived:
- 01-foundation/
- 02-auth/
- 03-core-features/

Destination: .planning/milestones/v{X.Y}-phases/

### v{X.Z} — {Milestone Name}
These phase directories will be archived:
- 04-security/
- 05-hardening/

Destination: .planning/milestones/v{X.Z}-phases/
```

**Stale local branches (upstream gone):**

First, update remote-tracking refs so the candidate list matches the execution list exactly:

```bash
git fetch --prune 2>/dev/null || true
```

Then enumerate candidates (protected branch names are excluded even if their upstream is gone):

```bash
git branch -vv | awk '/: gone\]/ { if ($1 !~ /^\*$|^main$|^next$|^trunk$|^develop$/) print $1 }'
```

Show each branch name. If none, show:

```
No stale local branches detected.
```

If no phase directories remain to archive (all already moved or deleted) AND no stale branches exist:

```
No phase directories found to archive. Phases may have been removed or archived previously.
No stale local branches detected either.
```

Stop here.

**Text mode (`workflow.text_mode: true` in config or `--text` flag):** Set `TEXT_MODE=true` if `--text` is present in `$ARGUMENTS` OR `text_mode` from init JSON is `true`. When TEXT_MODE is active, replace every `AskUserQuestion` call with a plain-text numb...
AskUserQuestion: "Proceed with archiving and pruning?" with options: "Yes — archive phases and prune stale branches" | "Cancel"

If "Cancel": Stop.

</step>

<step name="archive_phases">

For each milestone, move phase directories:

```bash
mkdir -p .planning/milestones/v{X.Y}-phases
```

For each phase directory belonging to this milestone:

```bash
mv .planning/phases/{dir} .planning/milestones/v{X.Y}-phases/
```

Repeat for all milestones in the cleanup set.

</step>

<step name="prune_local_branches">

After phase archival, prune local branches whose upstream has been deleted. Use the same filter as the dry-run so the execution list matches exactly what the user confirmed:

```bash
git branch -vv | awk '/: gone\]/ { if ($1 !~ /^\*$|^main$|^next$|^trunk$|^develop$/) print $1 }' | xargs -r git branch -D
```

Notes:
- `git fetch --prune` already ran in `show_dry_run` — the tracking refs are current and this step enumerates from the same state the user confirmed.
- `!~ /^\*$/` skips the currently checked-out branch (prefixed with `* ` in `git branch -vv` output, so `$1` yields `*`).
- `!~ /^main$|^next$|^trunk$|^develop$/` excludes protected branch names even if their upstream is gone — matches the dry-run exclusion exactly.
- `xargs -r` prevents `git branch -D` from running with no arguments when no stale branches exist.

</step>

<step name="commit">

Commit the changes:

```bash
- Native commit helper translated: do not auto-commit; only run git commit when the user explicitly asks, after reporting files and validation.
```

</step>

<step name="report">

```
Archived:
{For each milestone}
- v{X.Y}: {N} phase directories → .planning/milestones/v{X.Y}-phases/

Pruned: {N} local branches whose upstream is gone.

.planning/phases/ cleaned up.
```

</step>
