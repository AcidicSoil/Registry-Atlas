# Bridge Workflow: new-project

<!-- generated-by: pnpm gen:bridge-commands -->

## Purpose

This bridge workflow runbook translates the actual GSD-core workflow information and adapts it for Serena bridge operation. Read it when operating `gsd-workflow-new-project` in a target project.

## Bridge Entry

```bash
gsd-serena-bridge bootstrap --format markdown
gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
```

If setup is stale or broken, run:

```bash
gsd-serena-bridge repair --format markdown
gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
```

Primary bridge route:

```text
Use `gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown` to map this workflow intent to an implemented bridge command or operation plan.
```

For natural-language requests, classify first:

```bash
cat <<'EOF_REQUEST' | gsd-serena-bridge resolve --stdin --format markdown
<verbatim user request>
EOF_REQUEST
```

## Bridge Substitution Rules

- Preserve the GSD-core trigger, purpose, process steps, decision logic, and quality bar from the source workflow below.
- Replace native `/gsd:*` slash commands with `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown` when implemented.
- Replace native `gsd_run query ...` calls with bridge commands, resolver packets, installed contracts, or explicit operation plans.
- Replace native `Agent(...)` dispatch with Serena role workflows, generated role skills, sequential role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Do not run native shell snippets that mutate state unless a bridge command or operation plan authorizes the same write set and validation.
- Do not claim exact native behavior for adapted-safe or planned rows. Name the bridge substitute and remaining gap.

## Source Evidence

- Contract ID: `gsd-workflow-new-project`
- Status: `planned`
- Source path: `gsd-core/workflows/new-project.md`
- Resolved source path: `vendor/reference/gsd-core/gsd-core/workflows/new-project.md`
- Mirrored runbook path: `.agents/gsd-serena/workflows/new-project.md`

## Translated GSD Workflow

### Native Shim Translation
- Native GSD shim locator omitted: the bridge uses the installed `gsd-serena-bridge` CLI, `bootstrap`, `doctor`, `repair`, resolver packets, and install-managed project surfaces instead of locating `gsd-tools.cjs`.
<purpose>
Initialize a new project through unified flow: questioning, research (optional), requirements, roadmap. This is the most leveraged moment in any project — deep questioning here means better plans, better execution, better outcomes. One workflow takes you fr...
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.
</required_reading>

<available_agent_types>
Valid GSD subagent types (use exact names — do not fall back to 'general-purpose'):
- gsd-project-researcher — Researches project-level technical decisions
- gsd-research-synthesizer — Synthesizes findings from parallel research agents
- gsd-roadmapper — Creates phased execution roadmaps
</available_agent_types>

<auto_mode>

## Auto Mode Detection

Check if `--auto` flag is present in $ARGUMENTS.

**If auto mode:**

- Skip brownfield mapping offer (assume greenfield)
- Skip deep questioning (extract context from provided document)
- Config: YOLO mode is implicit (skip that question), but ask granularity/git/agents FIRST (Step 2a)
- After config: run Steps 6-9 automatically with smart defaults:
- Research: Always yes
- Requirements: Include all table stakes + features from provided document
- Requirements approval: Auto-approve
- Roadmap approval: Auto-approve

**Document requirement:**
Auto mode requires an idea document — either:

- File reference: ``gsd-serena-bridge new-project --format markdown` --auto @prd.md`
- Pasted/written text in the prompt

If no document content provided, error:

```
Error: --auto requires an idea document.

Usage:
`gsd-serena-bridge new-project --format markdown` --auto @your-idea.md
`gsd-serena-bridge new-project --format markdown` --auto [paste or write your idea here]

The document should describe what you want to build.
```

</auto_mode>

## 1. Setup

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP — Execute these checks before ANY user interaction:**

```bash
- Native query translated: `INIT=$(gsd_run query init.new-project)` -> use the closest `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown`, resolver packet, installed contract, or explicit operation-plan step with validation.
if [[ "$INIT" == @file:* ]]; then INIT=$(cat "${INIT#@file:}"); fi
- Native query translated: `AGENT_SKILLS_RESEARCHER=$(gsd_run query agent-skills gsd-project-researcher)` -> use the closest `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown`, resolver packet, installed contract, or explicit operation-plan step with validation.
- Native query translated: `AGENT_SKILLS_SYNTHESIZER=$(gsd_run query agent-skills gsd-research-synthesizer)` -> use the closest `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown`, resolver packet, installed contract, or explicit operation-plan step with validation.
- Native query translated: `AGENT_SKILLS_ROADMAPPER=$(gsd_run query agent-skills gsd-roadmapper)` -> use the closest `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown`, resolver packet, installed contract, or explicit operation-plan step with validation.
```

Parse JSON for: `researcher_model`, `synthesizer_model`, `roadmapper_model`, `commit_docs`, `project_exists`, `has_codebase_map`, `planning_exists`, `has_existing_code`, `has_package_file`, `is_brownfield`, `needs_codebase_map`, `has_git`, `git_worktree_roo...

**If `agents_installed` is false:** Display a warning before proceeding:
```text
⚠ GSD agents not installed. The following agents are missing from your agents directory:
{missing_agents joined with newline}

Runtime checked: {agent_runtime}
Agents directory checked: {agents_dir}
Required new-project agents missing:
{missing_required_agents joined with newline, or "none"}

Agent skill payloads available: {agent_skill_payloads_available}
Agent skill payload agents:
{agent_skill_payload_agents joined with newline, or "none"}

Skill payloads only provide prompt context. Named subagent spawns still require agent
definitions to be installed for this runtime.

Subagent spawns (gsd-project-researcher, gsd-research-synthesizer, gsd-roadmapper) will fail
with "agent type not found" if `required_agents_installed` is false. Run the installer with --global to make agents available:

npx @opengsd/gsd-core@latest --global

Proceeding without research subagents — roadmap will be generated inline.
```
Skip Steps 6–7 (parallel research and synthesis) and proceed directly to roadmap creation in Step 8.

**Detect runtime and set instruction file name:**

Derive `RUNTIME` from the invoking prompt's `execution_context` path:
- Path contains `/.codex/` → `RUNTIME=codex`
- Path contains `/.gemini/` → `RUNTIME=gemini`
- Path contains `/.config/opencode/` or `/.opencode/` → `RUNTIME=opencode`
- Otherwise → `RUNTIME=claude`

If `execution_context` path is not available, fall back to env vars:
```bash
if [ -n "$CODEX_HOME" ]; then RUNTIME="codex"
elif [ -n "$GEMINI_CONFIG_DIR" ]; then RUNTIME="gemini"
elif [ -n "$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR" ] || [ -n "$OPENCODE_CONFIG" ]; then RUNTIME="opencode"
else RUNTIME="claude"; fi
```

- Native query translated: `Set the instruction file variable via the shared runtime-name policy adapter ('gsd-tools query project-instruction-file', backed by 'getProjectInstructionFile' in 'runtime-name-policy.cjs' — the single source of truth shared with 'profile-output.cjs'):` -> use the closest `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown`, resolver packet, installed contract, or explicit operation-plan step with validation.
```bash
- Native query translated: `INSTRUCTION_FILE=$(gsd_run query project-instruction-file --runtime "$RUNTIME")` -> use the closest `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown`, resolver packet, installed contract, or explicit operation-plan step with validation.
```

All subsequent references to the project instruction file use `$INSTRUCTION_FILE`.

**If `project_exists` is true:** Error — project already initialized. Use ``gsd-serena-bridge progress --format markdown``.

**Git init (#3491 — never nest `.git` inside an existing worktree):**

- If `has_git` true and `in_nested_subdir` true: skip `git init`; warn `⚠ Initializing inside existing worktree (${git_worktree_root}); planning files will track to outer repo.`
- If `has_git` true and `in_nested_subdir` false: skip `git init` (already at worktree root).
- If `has_git` false: `git init`.

## 2. Brownfield Offer

**If auto mode:** Skip to Step 4 (assume greenfield, synthesize PROJECT.md from provided document).

**If `needs_codebase_map` is true** (from init — existing code detected but no codebase map):

**Text mode (`workflow.text_mode: true` in config or `--text` flag):** Set `TEXT_MODE=true` if `--text` is present in `$ARGUMENTS` OR `text_mode` from init JSON is `true`. When TEXT_MODE is active, replace every `AskUserQuestion` call with a plain-text numb...
Use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Codebase"
- question: "I detected existing code in this directory. Would you like to map the codebase first?"
- options:
- "Map codebase first" — Run `gsd-serena-bridge map-codebase --format markdown` to understand existing architecture (Recommended)
- "Skip mapping" — Proceed with project initialization

**If "Map codebase first":**

```
Run ``gsd-serena-bridge map-codebase --format markdown`` first, then return to ``gsd-serena-bridge new-project --format markdown``
```

Exit command.

**If "Skip mapping" OR `needs_codebase_map` is false:** Continue to Step 3.

## 2a. Auto Mode Config (auto mode only)

**If auto mode:** Collect config settings upfront before processing the idea document.

YOLO mode is implicit (auto = YOLO). Ask remaining config questions:

**Round 1 — Core settings (3 questions, no Mode question):**

```
AskUserQuestion([
{
header: "Granularity",
question: "How finely should scope be sliced into phases?",
multiSelect: false,
options: [
{ label: "Coarse (Recommended)", description: "Fewer, broader phases (3-5 phases, 1-3 plans each)" },
{ label: "Standard", description: "Balanced phase size (5-8 phases, 3-5 plans each)" },
{ label: "Fine", description: "Many focused phases (8-12 phases, 5-10 plans each)" }
]
},
{
header: "Execution",
question: "Run plans in parallel?",
multiSelect: false,
options: [
{ label: "Parallel (Recommended)", description: "Independent plans run simultaneously" },
{ label: "Sequential", description: "One plan at a time" }
]
},
{
header: "Git Tracking",
question: "Commit planning docs to git?",
multiSelect: false,
options: [
{ label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Planning docs tracked in version control" },
{ label: "No", description: "Keep .planning/ local-only (add to .gitignore)" }
]
}
])
```

**Round 2 — Workflow agents (same as Step 5):**

```
AskUserQuestion([
{
header: "Research",
question: "Research before planning each phase? (adds tokens/time)",
multiSelect: false,
options: [
{ label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Investigate domain, find patterns, surface gotchas" },
{ label: "No", description: "Plan directly from requirements" }
]
},
{
header: "Plan Check",
question: "Verify plans will achieve their goals? (adds tokens/time)",
multiSelect: false,
options: [
{ label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Catch gaps before execution starts" },
{ label: "No", description: "Execute plans without verification" }
]
},
{
header: "Verifier",
question: "Verify work satisfies requirements after each phase? (adds tokens/time)",
multiSelect: false,
options: [
{ label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Confirm deliverables match phase goals" },
{ label: "No", description: "Trust execution, skip verification" }
]
},
{
header: "Drift Guard",
question: "Enable the plan drift-guard? It verifies that symbols your plans cite (decorators, classes, functions, CLI flags) actually exist in your source at review time, catching hallucinated names before execution. [Y/n]",
multiSelect: false,
options: [
{ label: "Yes (Recommended)", description: "Resolve symbol references against live source during plan review — catches hallucinated names before execution" },
{ label: "No", description: "Skip symbol grounding — plan review proceeds without source verification" }
]
},
{
header: "AI Models",
question: "Which AI models for planning agents?",
multiSelect: false,
options: [
{ label: "Balanced (Recommended)", description: "Sonnet for most agents — good quality/cost ratio" },
{ label: "Quality", description: "Opus for research/roadmap — higher cost, deeper analysis" },
{ label: "Budget", description: "Haiku where possible — fastest, lowest cost" },
{ label: "Inherit", description: "Use the current session model for all agents (OpenCode /model)" }
]
}
])
```

**Round 3 — PR body onboarding:**

Ask which optional PRD-style sections ``gsd-serena-bridge ship --format markdown`` should append to generated PR bodies. These map to `ship.pr_body_sections`; selected sections are written with `"enabled": true`, unselected seeded sections are written with `"enabled": false` so the project can enable them later without editing `ship.md`.

Prefer lean/agile PRD sections that make the delivered increment clear: user stories, acceptance criteria, Definition of Done or release criteria, risks, dependencies, and stakeholder review.

```
AskUserQuestion([
{
header: "PR Body",
question: "Which optional PRD-style sections should `gsd-serena-bridge ship --format markdown` include in PR bodies?",
multiSelect: true,
options: [
{ label: "User Stories & Acceptance Criteria", description: "Append user-facing stories and acceptance checks from REQUIREMENTS.md" },
{ label: "Risks & Dependencies", description: "Append rollout risks, dependencies, and rollback notes from PLAN.md" },
{ label: "Success Metrics & Release Criteria", description: "Append measurable Definition of Done and release checks for stakeholder review" },
{ label: "Stakeholder Review & Approval", description: "Append approval checklist for projects that need sign-off traceability" }
]
}
])
```

Build `ship.pr_body_sections` from those choices. For selected options, set `enabled: true`; for seeded but unselected options, set `enabled: false`. If the user selects none, use `"ship":{"pr_body_sections":[]}`.

Create `.planning/config.json` with all settings (CLI fills in remaining defaults automatically):

```bash
mkdir -p .planning
- Native query translated: `gsd_run query config-new-project '{"mode":"yolo","granularity":"[selected]","parallelization":true|false,"commit_docs":true|false,"model_profile":"quality|balanced|budget|inherit","workflow":{"research":true|false,"plan_check":true|false,"verifier":true|false,"nyquist_validation":true|false,"auto_advance":true},"plan_review":{"source_grounding":true|false},"ship":{"pr_body_sections":[{"heading":"User Stories & Acceptance Criteria","enabled":true|false,"source":"REQUIREMENTS.md ## User Stories || REQUIREMENTS.md ## Acceptance Criteria","fallback":"- Acceptance criteria are covered by the linked requirements and verification evidence."},{"heading":"Risks & Dependencies","enabled":true|false,"source":"PLAN.md ## Risks || PLAN.md ## Dependencies","fallback":"- No known high-risk rollout dependencies."},{"heading":"Success Metrics & Release Criteria","enabled":true|false,"source":"REQUIREMENTS.md ## Definition of Done || VERIFICATION.md ## Release Criteria","fallback":"- Release when automated verification and required manual checks pass."},{"heading":"Stakeholder Review & Approval","enabled":true|false,"template":"- Product owner approval pending for {phase_name}."}]}}'` -> use the closest `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown`, resolver packet, installed contract, or explicit operation-plan step with validation.
```

**If commit_docs = No:** Add `.planning/` to `.gitignore`.

**Commit config.json:**

- Source translation truncated here; use the bridge command output, workflow runbook, installed contracts, or operation plan for continuation.
