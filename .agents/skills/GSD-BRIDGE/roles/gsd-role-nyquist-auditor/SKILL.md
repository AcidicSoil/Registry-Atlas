# Fills Nyquist validation gaps by generating tests and verifying coverage for phase requirements

## Purpose

Use this generated bridge skill as a source-informed runbook for `gsd-role-nyquist-auditor`. It preserves the actual GSD-core command/workflow/role material where available and overlays the Serena bridge execution rules needed to operate safely in installed target projects.

## Bridge Adaptation Overlay

Use the GSD-core source material below for intent, trigger, decision logic, and quality bar. Execute through the Serena bridge, not through native GSD-core runtime dispatch.

### Command Mapping

- No direct bridge entrypoint is declared. Use resolver and an explicit operation plan.

### Runtime Substitutions

- Native `/gsd:*` slash commands map to `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown` when the bridge exposes the command.
- Native `gsd_run query ...` helpers map to bridge commands, resolver packets, installed registry contracts, or explicit operation plans. Do not invent a missing query result.
- Native `Agent(...)` / subagent dispatch maps to installed GSD agent contracts under `.agents/gsd-serena/agents/**`, vendor-shaped GSD runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, Serena role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Native Skill references map to vendor-shaped GSD runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, GSD references under `.agents/gsd-serena/gsd-core/references/**`, and workflow runbooks under `.agents/gsd-serena/workflows/**`.
- Native mutation, git commit, branch, or worktree behavior must be translated into bridge-owned commands, operation plans, validators, allowed writes, checkpoints, and rollback notes. Do not auto-create git commits unless the user explicitly asks for that git action.


### Execution Rule

Treat this as planned guidance. Route through resolver and implemented commands when possible; otherwise produce a concrete bridge operation plan with reads, writes, validation, rollback, and next action.

## Preflight

Run this from the target project root unless the user is explicitly asking about the bridge source repository.

1. Check setup and current direction when the session is new or setup freshness is unclear:

   ```bash
   gsd-serena-bridge bootstrap --format markdown
   ```

2. If bootstrap or doctor reports stale/broken bridge-owned install-managed surfaces, automatically repair and recheck before continuing:

   ```bash
   gsd-serena-bridge repair --format markdown
   gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
   ```

3. Repair is limited to bridge-owned installed surfaces such as `.agents/gsd-serena/**`, bridge `.serena/**` setup, and managed bridge blocks in `AGENTS.md` / `.gitignore`.
4. Do not treat repair as permission to overwrite user-owned `.planning/STATE.md`, native `.gsd/**`, or product files.
5. Status decision for this role skill: Treat this as planned guidance. Route through resolver and implemented commands when possible; otherwise produce a concrete bridge operation plan with reads, writes, validation, rollback, and next action.

## Procedure

1. Read the GSD Source Translation below first. Extract the role's purpose, required reads, tools, output contract, and quality rules.
2. Apply the Bridge Adaptation Overlay above before executing anything.
3. Treat this as a Serena role-workflow packet, not as vendor-native subagent dispatch.
4. Complete the preflight above. If repair was needed, rerun doctor before role work starts.
5. State the active role frame and the bounded task the role is allowed to perform.
6. Route mutations through an implemented bridge command, resolver packet, or explicit operation plan before changing files.
7. Use the role to inspect, decide, and report. Mutate only when the command packet or operation plan gives an allowed write set and validation command.
8. When vendor-native Agent/Subagent behavior is unavailable, substitute Serena role workflow steps: inspect evidence, produce decisions, write bounded artifacts, validate, and hand off.
9. End with a handoff that names changed files, evidence, validation, remaining risk, and next command.

## Decision Flow

- If status is `supported` or `adapted-safe`: use the bridge entrypoint/resolver and report the bridge command or substitute actually used.
- If status is `planned` or `asset-only`: continue through resolver, generated workflow runbook, Serena role workflow, or explicit operation plan with validation.
- If status is `manual-fallback`: provide bounded manual instructions plus a bridge operation plan where writes are needed.
- If status is `blocked`: do not dead-end the workflow; convert native-only behavior into the closest bridge-safe operation plan or role workflow and record the missing native capability as follow-up evidence.
- If required reads are missing: gather them through bridge commands or ask only for the smallest missing decision needed to continue.
- If validation fails: fix only in-scope issues, rerun validation, and keep the state transition pending until validation passes.

## Validation and Completion

No command-specific validation is declared in the contract. Use the command output, resolver packet, operation plan validation, and any GSD-core source validation criteria preserved below. Use `gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown` only to confirm setup health, not to claim command success.

Before reporting done, include:

- the GSD source translation sections used;
- the bridge command, resolver packet, operation plan, or role workflow used;
- files read and changed;
- validation commands and outcomes;
- state transition status, if any;
- remaining adapted-safe gaps or native GSD behavior not implemented by the bridge.

## Recovery

- Setup stale or broken: run repair, then doctor, then bootstrap/state-next before continuing.
- Resolver cannot classify the request: produce a narrow continuation plan from the GSD-core source and ask only for the smallest missing decision; do not start unscoped work.
- Packet forbidden-write violation: stop, isolate unrelated edits, and resolve a new request for the broader work.
- Missing artifact: create only artifacts inside the allowed write set or report the exact missing input.
- Native GSD behavior requested but not implemented: execute the bridge substitute through a command, workflow runbook, role workflow, or explicit operation plan; cite the contract status `planned`, explain the safe bridge substitute, and record a future parity slice.

## Boundaries

## Runtime Capability

No command-level runtime capability row is available for this generated surface. Use resolver output and the parity skill contract for current behavior.

## GSD Source Translation

The source-derived guidance below is translated for the Serena bridge. Native runtime locator code, shim functions, direct `gsd-tools.cjs` discovery, native agent dispatch, and git/worktree helpers are converted into bridge commands, resolver packets, Serena role workflows, or validation-gated operation plans.

<role>
A completed phase has validation gaps submitted for adversarial test coverage. For each gap: generate a real behavioral test that can fail, run it, and report what actually happens — not what the implementation claims.

For each gap in `<gaps>`: generate minimal behavioral test, run it, debug if failing (max 3 iterations), report results.

**Mandatory Initial Read:** If prompt contains `<required_reading>`, load ALL listed files before any action.

**Implementation files are READ-ONLY.** Only create/modify: test files, fixtures, VALIDATION.md. Implementation bugs → ESCALATE. Never fix implementation.
</role>

<adversarial_stance>
**FORCE stance:** Assume every gap is genuinely uncovered until a passing test proves the requirement is satisfied. Your starting hypothesis: the implementation does not meet the requirement. Write tests that can fail.

**Common failure modes — how Nyquist auditors go soft:**
- Writing tests that pass trivially because they test a simpler behavior than the requirement demands
- Generating tests only for easy-to-test cases while skipping the gap's hard behavioral edge
- Treating "test file created" as "gap filled" before the test actually runs and passes
- Marking gaps as SKIP without escalating — a skipped gap is an unverified requirement, not a resolved one
- Debugging a failing test by weakening the assertion rather than fixing the implementation via ESCALATE

**Required finding classification:**
- **BLOCKER** — gap test fails after 3 iterations; requirement unmet; ESCALATE to developer
- **WARNING** — gap test passes but with caveats (partial coverage, environment-specific, not deterministic)
Every gap must resolve to FILLED (test passes), ESCALATED (BLOCKER), or explicitly justified SKIP.
</adversarial_stance>

<execution_flow>

<step name="load_context">
Read ALL files from `<required_reading>`. Extract:
- Implementation: exports, public API, input/output contracts
- PLANs: requirement IDs, task structure, verify blocks
- SUMMARYs: what was implemented, files changed, deviations
- Test infrastructure: framework, config, runner commands, conventions
- Existing VALIDATION.md: current map, compliance status

**Context budget:** Load project skills first (lightweight). Read implementation files incrementally — load only what each check requires, not the full codebase upfront.

**Project skills:** Check `.claude/skills/` or `.agents/skills/` directory if either exists:
1. List available skills (subdirectories)
2. Read `SKILL.md` for each skill (lightweight index ~130 lines)
3. Load specific `rules/*.md` files as needed during implementation
4. Do NOT load full `AGENTS.md` files (100KB+ context cost)
5. Apply skill rules to match project test framework conventions and required coverage patterns.

This ensures project-specific patterns, conventions, and best practices are applied during execution.
</step>

<step name="analyze_gaps">
For each gap in `<gaps>`:

1. Read related implementation files
2. Identify observable behavior the requirement demands
3. Classify test type:

| Behavior | Test Type |
|----------|-----------|
| Pure function I/O | Unit |
| API endpoint | Integration |
| CLI command | Smoke |
| DB/filesystem operation | Integration |

4. Map to test file path per project conventions

Action by gap type:
- `no_test_file` → Create test file
- `test_fails` → Diagnose and fix the test (not impl)
- `no_automated_command` → Determine command, update map
</step>

<step name="generate_tests">
Convention discovery: existing tests → framework defaults → fallback.

| Framework | File Pattern | Runner | Assert Style |
|-----------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| pytest | `test_{name}.py` | `pytest {file} -v` | `assert result == expected` |
| jest | `{name}.test.ts` | `npx jest {file}` | `expect(result).toBe(expected)` |
| vitest | `{name}.test.ts` | `npx vitest run {file}` | `expect(result).toBe(expected)` |
| go test | `{name}_test.go` | `go test -v -run {Name}` | `if got != want { t.Errorf(...) }` |

Per gap: Write test file. One focused test per requirement behavior. Arrange/Act/Assert. Behavioral test names (`test_user_can_reset_password`), not structural (`test_reset_function`).
</step>

<step name="run_and_verify">
Execute each test. If passes: record success, next gap. If fails: enter debug loop.

Run every test. Never mark untested tests as passing.
</step>

<step name="debug_loop">
Max 3 iterations per failing test.

| Failure Type | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| Import/syntax/fixture error | Fix test, re-run |
| Assertion: actual matches impl but violates requirement | IMPLEMENTATION BUG → ESCALATE |
| Assertion: test expectation wrong | Fix assertion, re-run |
| Environment/runtime error | ESCALATE |

Track: `{ gap_id, iteration, error_type, action, result }`

After 3 failed iterations: ESCALATE with requirement, expected vs actual behavior, impl file reference.
</step>

<step name="report">
Resolved gaps: `{ task_id, requirement, test_type, automated_command, file_path, status: "green" }`
Escalated gaps: `{ task_id, requirement, reason, debug_iterations, last_error }`

Return one of three formats below.
</step>
