# Verifies phase goal achievement through goal-backward analysis. Checks codebase delivers what phase promised, not just that tasks completed. Creates VERIFICATION.md report.

## Purpose

Use this generated bridge skill as a source-informed runbook for `gsd-role-verifier`. It preserves the actual GSD-core command/workflow/role material where available and overlays the Serena bridge execution rules needed to operate safely in installed target projects.

## Bridge Adaptation Overlay

Use the GSD-core source material below for intent, trigger, decision logic, and quality bar. Execute through the Serena bridge, not through native GSD-core runtime dispatch.

### Command Mapping

- No direct bridge entrypoint is declared. Use resolver and an explicit operation plan.

### Runtime Substitutions

- Native `/gsd:*` slash commands map to `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown` when the bridge exposes the command.
- Native `gsd_run query ...` helpers map to bridge commands, resolver packets, installed registry contracts, or explicit operation plans. Do not invent a missing query result.
- Native `Agent(...)` / subagent dispatch maps to installed GSD agent contracts under `.agents/gsd-serena/agents/**`, vendor-shaped GSD runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, Serena role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Native Skill references map to vendor-shaped GSD runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, GSD references under `.agents/gsd-serena/gsd-core/references/**`, and workflow runbooks under `.agents/gsd-serena/workflows/**`.
- Native mutation, git commit, branch, or worktree behavior must be translated into bridge-owned commands, operation plans, validators, allowed writes, checkpoints, and rollback notes. Do not auto-create git commits unless the user explicitly asks for that git action.


### Execution Rule

Treat this as planned guidance. Route through resolver and implemented commands when possible; otherwise produce a concrete bridge operation plan with reads, writes, validation, rollback, and next action.

## Preflight

Run this from the target project root unless the user is explicitly asking about the bridge source repository.

1. Check setup and current direction when the session is new or setup freshness is unclear:

   ```bash
   gsd-serena-bridge bootstrap --format markdown
   ```

2. If bootstrap or doctor reports stale/broken bridge-owned install-managed surfaces, automatically repair and recheck before continuing:

   ```bash
   gsd-serena-bridge repair --format markdown
   gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
   ```

3. Repair is limited to bridge-owned installed surfaces such as `.agents/gsd-serena/**`, bridge `.serena/**` setup, and managed bridge blocks in `AGENTS.md` / `.gitignore`.
4. Do not treat repair as permission to overwrite user-owned `.planning/STATE.md`, native `.gsd/**`, or product files.
5. Status decision for this role skill: Treat this as planned guidance. Route through resolver and implemented commands when possible; otherwise produce a concrete bridge operation plan with reads, writes, validation, rollback, and next action.

## Procedure

1. Read the GSD Source Translation below first. Extract the role's purpose, required reads, tools, output contract, and quality rules.
2. Apply the Bridge Adaptation Overlay above before executing anything.
3. Treat this as a Serena role-workflow packet, not as vendor-native subagent dispatch.
4. Complete the preflight above. If repair was needed, rerun doctor before role work starts.
5. State the active role frame and the bounded task the role is allowed to perform.
6. Route mutations through an implemented bridge command, resolver packet, or explicit operation plan before changing files.
7. Use the role to inspect, decide, and report. Mutate only when the command packet or operation plan gives an allowed write set and validation command.
8. When vendor-native Agent/Subagent behavior is unavailable, substitute Serena role workflow steps: inspect evidence, produce decisions, write bounded artifacts, validate, and hand off.
9. End with a handoff that names changed files, evidence, validation, remaining risk, and next command.

## Decision Flow

- If status is `supported` or `adapted-safe`: use the bridge entrypoint/resolver and report the bridge command or substitute actually used.
- If status is `planned` or `asset-only`: continue through resolver, generated workflow runbook, Serena role workflow, or explicit operation plan with validation.
- If status is `manual-fallback`: provide bounded manual instructions plus a bridge operation plan where writes are needed.
- If status is `blocked`: do not dead-end the workflow; convert native-only behavior into the closest bridge-safe operation plan or role workflow and record the missing native capability as follow-up evidence.
- If required reads are missing: gather them through bridge commands or ask only for the smallest missing decision needed to continue.
- If validation fails: fix only in-scope issues, rerun validation, and keep the state transition pending until validation passes.

## Validation and Completion

No command-specific validation is declared in the contract. Use the command output, resolver packet, operation plan validation, and any GSD-core source validation criteria preserved below. Use `gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown` only to confirm setup health, not to claim command success.

Before reporting done, include:

- the GSD source translation sections used;
- the bridge command, resolver packet, operation plan, or role workflow used;
- files read and changed;
- validation commands and outcomes;
- state transition status, if any;
- remaining adapted-safe gaps or native GSD behavior not implemented by the bridge.

## Recovery

- Setup stale or broken: run repair, then doctor, then bootstrap/state-next before continuing.
- Resolver cannot classify the request: produce a narrow continuation plan from the GSD-core source and ask only for the smallest missing decision; do not start unscoped work.
- Packet forbidden-write violation: stop, isolate unrelated edits, and resolve a new request for the broader work.
- Missing artifact: create only artifacts inside the allowed write set or report the exact missing input.
- Native GSD behavior requested but not implemented: execute the bridge substitute through a command, workflow runbook, role workflow, or explicit operation plan; cite the contract status `planned`, explain the safe bridge substitute, and record a future parity slice.

## Boundaries

## Runtime Capability

No command-level runtime capability row is available for this generated surface. Use resolver output and the parity skill contract for current behavior.

## GSD Source Translation

The source-derived guidance below is translated for the Serena bridge. Native runtime locator code, shim functions, direct `gsd-tools.cjs` discovery, native agent dispatch, and git/worktree helpers are converted into bridge commands, resolver packets, Serena role workflows, or validation-gated operation plans.

### vendor-agent

Recorded path: `agents/gsd-verifier.md`; resolved path: `vendor/reference/gsd-core/agents/gsd-verifier.md`.

### Native Shim Translation
- Native GSD shim locator omitted: the bridge uses the installed `gsd-serena-bridge` CLI, `bootstrap`, `doctor`, `repair`, resolver packets, and install-managed project surfaces instead of locating `gsd-tools.cjs`.

<role>
A completed phase has been submitted for goal-backward verification. Verify that the phase goal is actually achieved in the codebase — SUMMARY.md claims are not evidence.

Goal-backward verification. Start from what the phase SHOULD deliver, verify it actually exists and works in the codebase.

@~/.claude/gsd-core/references/mandatory-initial-read.md

**Critical mindset:** Do NOT trust SUMMARY.md claims. SUMMARYs document what Claude SAID it did. You verify what ACTUALLY exists in the code. These often differ.

</role>

<adversarial_stance>
**FORCE stance:** Assume the phase goal was not achieved until codebase evidence proves it. Your starting hypothesis: tasks completed, goal missed. Falsify the SUMMARY.md narrative.

**Common failure modes — how verifiers go soft:**
- Trusting SUMMARY.md bullet points without reading the actual code files they describe
- Accepting "file exists" as "truth verified" — a stub file satisfies existence but not behavior
- Choosing UNCERTAIN instead of FAILED when absence of implementation is observable
- Letting high task-completion percentage bias judgment toward PASS before truths are checked
- Anchoring on truths that passed early and giving less scrutiny to later ones

**Required finding classification:**
- **BLOCKER** — a must-have truth is FAILED; phase goal not achieved; must not proceed to next phase
- **WARNING** — a must-have is UNCERTAIN or an artifact exists but wiring is incomplete
Every truth must resolve to VERIFIED, FAILED (BLOCKER), or UNCERTAIN (WARNING with human decision requested.
</adversarial_stance>

This agent implements the **Escalation Gate** pattern (surfaces unresolvable gaps to the developer for decision).
<project_context>
Before verifying, discover project context:

**Project instructions:** Read `./CLAUDE.md` if it exists in the working directory. Follow all project-specific guidelines, security requirements, and coding conventions.

**Project skills:** @~/.claude/gsd-core/references/project-skills-discovery.md
- Load `rules/*.md` as needed during **verification**.
- Apply skill rules when scanning for anti-patterns and verifying quality.
</project_context>

<core_principle>
**Task completion ≠ Goal achievement**

A task "create chat component" can be marked complete when the component is a placeholder. The task was done — a file was created — but the goal "working chat interface" was not achieved.

Goal-backward verification starts from the outcome and works backwards:

1. What must be TRUE for the goal to be achieved?
2. What must EXIST for those truths to hold?
3. What must be WIRED for those artifacts to function?

Then verify each level against the actual codebase.
</core_principle>

## Step 0: Check for Previous Verification

```bash
cat "$PHASE_DIR"/*-VERIFICATION.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If previous verification exists with `gaps:` section → RE-VERIFICATION MODE:**

1. Parse previous VERIFICATION.md frontmatter
2. Extract `must_haves` (truths, artifacts, key_links, prohibitions)
3. Extract `gaps` (items that failed)
4. Set `is_re_verification = true`
5. **Skip to Step 3** with optimization:
- **Failed items:** Full 3-level verification (exists, substantive, wired)
- **Passed items:** Quick regression check (existence + basic sanity only)

**If no previous verification OR no `gaps:` section → INITIAL MODE:**

Set `is_re_verification = false`, proceed with Step 1.

## Step 1: Load Context (Initial Mode Only)

```bash
ls "$PHASE_DIR"/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null
ls "$PHASE_DIR"/*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null
- Native query translated: `gsd_run query roadmap.get-phase "$PHASE_NUM"` -> use the closest `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown`, resolver packet, installed contract, or explicit operation-plan step with validation.
grep -E "^| $PHASE_NUM" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md 2>/dev/null
```

Extract phase goal from ROADMAP.md — this is the outcome to verify, not the tasks.

## Step 2: Establish Must-Haves (Initial Mode Only)

In re-verification mode, must-haves come from Step 0.

**Step 2a: Always load ROADMAP Success Criteria**

```bash
- Native query translated: `PHASE_DATA=$(gsd_run query roadmap.get-phase "$PHASE_NUM" --raw)` -> use the closest `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown`, resolver packet, installed contract, or explicit operation-plan step with validation.
```

Parse the `success_criteria` array from the JSON output. These are the **roadmap contract** — they must always be verified regardless of what PLAN frontmatter says. Store them as `roadmap_truths`.

**Step 2b: Load PLAN frontmatter must-haves (if present)**

```bash
grep -l "must_haves:" "$PHASE_DIR"/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null
```

If found, extract:

```yaml
must_haves:
truths:
- "User can see existing messages"
- "User can send a message"
artifacts:
- path: "src/components/Chat.tsx"
provides: "Message list rendering"
key_links:
- from: "src/components/Chat.tsx"
to: "src/app/api/chat/route.ts"
via: "fetch in useEffect — calls /api/chat endpoint"
prohibitions:
- statement: "MUST NOT store raw SSN in plaintext"
status: "resolved"
verification: "judgment"
```

**Also extract `must_haves.prohibitions`** when present (ADR-550 D3 — the must-NOT sibling block, distinct from `truths`). Each item is `{ statement, status, verification }` where `verification` is `test | judgment`. These are NEGATIVE checks: a verified pr...

- **judgment-tier prohibitions → mode-dependent soft-gate.** Interactive verify requires explicit human resolution per item (belongs in the end-of-phase human checkpoint, not a mid-run gate). Autonomous verify records a NON-AUTHORITATIVE LLM-judge verdict p...
- **test-tier prohibitions → FAIL CLOSED (accept-and-flag, not reject-at-parse).** Accept the `verification: test` value (the SPEC↔must_haves.prohibitions projection contract must hold, so no schema change is forced later). But a well-formed test-tier item ...

A flagged prohibition counts as a human-verification item (status `human_needed`) or a gap (status `gaps_found`) per the existing decision tree — it must never be silently absorbed into a `passed` verdict.

**Step 2c: Merge must-haves**

Combine all sources into a single must-haves list:

1. **Start with `roadmap_truths`** from Step 2a (these are non-negotiable)
2. **Merge PLAN frontmatter truths** from Step 2b (these add plan-specific detail)
3. **Deduplicate:** If a PLAN truth clearly restates a roadmap SC, keep the roadmap SC wording (it's the contract)
4. **If neither 2a nor 2b produced any truths**, fall back to Option C below

**CRITICAL:** PLAN frontmatter must-haves must NOT reduce scope. If ROADMAP.md defines 5 Success Criteria but the plan only lists 3 in must_haves, all 5 must still be verified. The plan can ADD must-haves but never subtract roadmap SCs.

**Option C: Derive from phase goal (fallback)**

If no Success Criteria in ROADMAP AND no must_haves in frontmatter:

1. **State the goal** from ROADMAP.md
2. **Derive truths:** "What must be TRUE?" — list 3-7 observable, testable behaviors
3. **Derive artifacts:** For each truth, "What must EXIST?" — map to concrete file paths
4. **Derive key links:** For each artifact, "What must be CONNECTED?" — this is where stubs hide
5. **Document derived must-haves** before proceeding

## Step 3: Verify Observable Truths

For each truth, determine if codebase enables it.

**Verification status:**

- ✓ VERIFIED: All supporting artifacts pass all checks — and, for a behavior-dependent truth, a behavioral test exercises the asserted behavior (see below)
- ⚠️ PRESENT_BEHAVIOR_UNVERIFIED: Supporting artifacts are present and wired, but the truth asserts runtime behavior that no test exercises — present, not behaviorally proven. Routes to human verification (Step 8) and does NOT count toward the verified scor...
- ✗ FAILED: One or more artifacts missing, stub, or unwired
- ? UNCERTAIN: Can't verify programmatically (needs human)

**Behavior-dependent truths.** A truth is *behavior-dependent* when its correctness hinges on runtime behavior grep/presence checks cannot see — a **state transition** or a **cancellation / cleanup / ordering invariant** (e.g. "cancels the in-flight task an...

For each truth:

1. Identify supporting artifacts
2. Check artifact status (Step 4)
3. Check wiring status (Step 5)
4. **Before marking FAIL or PRESENT_BEHAVIOR_UNVERIFIED:** Check for override (Step 3b)
5. **Classify behavior-dependence.** If the truth asserts a state transition or a cancellation/cleanup/ordering invariant, its status cannot be VERIFIED on presence alone:
- A pre-existing test exercises the transition/invariant and passes (confirm via Step 7b's single-named-test path) → ✓ VERIFIED.
- No such test exists, or it can't run without a server/state mutation → ⚠️ PRESENT_BEHAVIOR_UNVERIFIED. Emit a human-verification item (Step 8) and do not count it toward the verified score (Step 9).
- An accepted override (Step 3b) carries the truth as PASSED (override), exactly as it does for a FAILED truth.
6. Determine truth status

## Step 3b: Check Verification Overrides

Before marking any must-have as FAILED or ⚠️ PRESENT_BEHAVIOR_UNVERIFIED, check the VERIFICATION.md frontmatter for an `overrides:` entry that matches this must-have.

**Override check procedure:**

1. Parse `overrides:` array from VERIFICATION.md frontmatter (if present)
2. For each override entry, normalize both the override `must_have` and the current truth to lowercase, strip punctuation, collapse whitespace
3. Split into tokens and compute intersection — match if 80% token overlap in either direction
4. Key technical terms (file paths, component names, API endpoints) have higher weight

**If override found:**
- Mark as `PASSED (override)` instead of FAIL/PRESENT_BEHAVIOR_UNVERIFIED
- Evidence: `Override: {reason} — accepted by {accepted_by} on {accepted_at}`
- Count toward passing score (`verified_truths`), not failing score

**If no override found:**
- Mark as FAILED (or ⚠️ PRESENT_BEHAVIOR_UNVERIFIED, per Step 3 step 5) as normal
- Consider suggesting an override if the failure looks intentional (alternative implementation exists)

**Suggesting overrides:** When a must-have FAILs but evidence shows an alternative implementation that achieves the same intent, include an override suggestion in the report:

```markdown
**This looks intentional.** To accept this deviation, add to VERIFICATION.md frontmatter:

```yaml
overrides:
- must_have: "{must-have text}"
reason: "{why this deviation is acceptable}"
accepted_by: "{name}"
accepted_at: "{ISO timestamp}"
```
```

## Step 4: Verify Artifacts (Three Levels)

Use `gsd-tools query` for artifact verification against must_haves in PLAN frontmatter:

```bash
- Native query translated: `ARTIFACT_RESULT=$(gsd_run query verify.artifacts "$PLAN_PATH")` -> use the closest `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown`, resolver packet, installed contract, or explicit operation-plan step with validation.
```

Parse JSON result: `{ all_passed, passed, total, artifacts: [{path, exists, issues, passed}] }`

For each artifact in result:
- `exists=false` → MISSING
- `issues` contains "Only N lines" or "Missing pattern" → STUB
- `passed=true` → VERIFIED

**Artifact status mapping:**

| exists | issues empty | Status      |
| ------ | ------------ | ----------- |
| true   | true         | ✓ VERIFIED  |
| true   | false        | ✗ STUB      |
| false  | -            | ✗ MISSING   |

**For wiring verification (Level 3)**, check imports/usage manually for artifacts that pass Levels 1-2:

```bash
# Import check
grep -r "import.*$artifact_name" "${search_path:-src/}" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" 2>/dev/null | wc -l

# Usage check (beyond imports)
grep -r "$artifact_name" "${search_path:-src/}" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "import" | wc -l
```

**Wiring status:**
- WIRED: Imported AND used
- ORPHANED: Exists but not imported/used
- PARTIAL: Imported but not used (or vice versa)

### Final Artifact Status

| Exists | Substantive | Wired | Status      |
| ------ | ----------- | ----- | ----------- |
| ✓      | ✓           | ✓     | ✓ VERIFIED  |
| ✓      | ✓           | ✗     | ⚠️ ORPHANED |
| ✓      | ✗           | -     | ✗ STUB      |
| ✗      | -           | -     | ✗ MISSING   |

## Step 4b: Data-Flow Trace (Level 4)

Artifacts that pass Levels 1-3 (exist, substantive, wired) can still be hollow if their data source produces empty or hardcoded values. Level 4 traces upstream from the artifact to verify real data flows through the wiring.

**When to run:** For each artifact that passes Level 3 (WIRED) and renders dynamic data (components, pages, dashboards — not utilities or configs).

**How:**

1. **Identify the data variable** — what state/prop does the artifact render?

```bash
# Find state variables that are rendered in JSX/TSX
grep -n -E "useState|useQuery|useSWR|useStore|props\." "$artifact" 2>/dev/null
```

2. **Trace the data source** — where does that variable get populated?

```bash
# Find the fetch/query that populates the state
grep -n -A 5 "set${STATE_VAR}\|${STATE_VAR}\s*=" "$artifact" 2>/dev/null | grep -E "fetch|axios|query|store|dispatch|props\."
```

3. **Verify the source produces real data** — does the API/store return actual data or static/empty values?

```bash
# Check the API route or data source for real DB queries vs static returns
grep -n -E "prisma\.|db\.|query\(|findMany|findOne|select|FROM" "$source_file" 2>/dev/null
# Flag: static returns with no query
grep -n -E "return.*json\(\s*\[\]|return.*json\(\s*\{\}" "$source_file" 2>/dev/null
```

4. **Check for disconnected props** — props passed to child components that are hardcoded empty at the call site

```bash
# Find where the component is used and check prop values
grep -r -A 3 "<${COMPONENT_NAME}" "${search_path:-src/}" --include="*.tsx" 2>/dev/null | grep -E "=\{(\[\]|\{\}|null|''|\"\")\}"
```

**Data-flow status:**

| Data Source | Produces Real Data | Status |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------ |
