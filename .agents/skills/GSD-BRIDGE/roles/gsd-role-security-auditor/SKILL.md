<!-- generated-by: pnpm gen:bridge-commands -->

# Verifies threat mitigations from PLAN.md threat model exist in implemented code. Produces SECURITY.md. Spawned by /gsd:secure-phase.

## Purpose

Use this generated bridge skill as a source-informed runbook for `gsd-role-security-auditor`. It preserves the actual GSD-core command/workflow/role material where available and overlays the Serena bridge execution rules needed to operate safely in installed target projects.

## Bridge Adaptation Overlay

Use the GSD-core source material below for intent, trigger, decision logic, and quality bar. Execute through the Serena bridge, not through native GSD-core runtime dispatch.

### Command Mapping

- No direct bridge entrypoint is declared. Use resolver and an explicit operation plan.

### Runtime Substitutions

- Native `/gsd:*` slash commands map to `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown` when the bridge exposes the command.
- Native `gsd_run query ...` helpers map to bridge commands, resolver packets, installed registry contracts, or explicit operation plans. Do not invent a missing query result.
- Native `Agent(...)` / subagent dispatch maps to installed GSD agent contracts under `.agents/gsd-serena/agents/**`, vendor-shaped GSD runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, Serena role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Native Skill references map to vendor-shaped GSD runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, GSD references under `.agents/gsd-serena/gsd-core/references/**`, and workflow runbooks under `.agents/gsd-serena/workflows/**`.
- Native mutation, git commit, branch, or worktree behavior must be translated into bridge-owned commands, operation plans, validators, allowed writes, checkpoints, and rollback notes. Do not auto-create git commits unless the user explicitly asks for that git action.


### Execution Rule

Treat this as planned guidance. Route through resolver and implemented commands when possible; otherwise produce a concrete bridge operation plan with reads, writes, validation, rollback, and next action.

## Preflight

Run this from the target project root unless the user is explicitly asking about the bridge source repository.

1. Check setup and current direction when the session is new or setup freshness is unclear:

   ```bash
   gsd-serena-bridge bootstrap --format markdown
   ```

2. If bootstrap or doctor reports stale/broken bridge-owned install-managed surfaces, automatically repair and recheck before continuing:

   ```bash
   gsd-serena-bridge repair --format markdown
   gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
   ```

3. Repair is limited to bridge-owned installed surfaces such as `.agents/gsd-serena/**`, bridge `.serena/**` setup, and managed bridge blocks in `AGENTS.md` / `.gitignore`.
4. Do not treat repair as permission to overwrite user-owned `.planning/STATE.md`, native `.gsd/**`, or product files.
5. Status decision for this role skill: Treat this as planned guidance. Route through resolver and implemented commands when possible; otherwise produce a concrete bridge operation plan with reads, writes, validation, rollback, and next action.

## Procedure

1. Read the GSD Source Translation below first. Extract the role's purpose, required reads, tools, output contract, and quality rules.
2. Apply the Bridge Adaptation Overlay above before executing anything.
3. Treat this as a Serena role-workflow packet, not as vendor-native subagent dispatch.
4. Complete the preflight above. If repair was needed, rerun doctor before role work starts.
5. State the active role frame and the bounded task the role is allowed to perform.
6. Route mutations through an implemented bridge command, resolver packet, or explicit operation plan before changing files.
7. Use the role to inspect, decide, and report. Mutate only when the command packet or operation plan gives an allowed write set and validation command.
8. When vendor-native Agent/Subagent behavior is unavailable, substitute Serena role workflow steps: inspect evidence, produce decisions, write bounded artifacts, validate, and hand off.
9. End with a handoff that names changed files, evidence, validation, remaining risk, and next command.

## Decision Flow

- If status is `supported` or `adapted-safe`: use the bridge entrypoint/resolver and report the bridge command or substitute actually used.
- If status is `planned` or `asset-only`: continue through resolver, generated workflow runbook, Serena role workflow, or explicit operation plan with validation.
- If status is `manual-fallback`: provide bounded manual instructions plus a bridge operation plan where writes are needed.
- If status is `blocked`: do not dead-end the workflow; convert native-only behavior into the closest bridge-safe operation plan or role workflow and record the missing native capability as follow-up evidence.
- If required reads are missing: gather them through bridge commands or ask only for the smallest missing decision needed to continue.
- If validation fails: fix only in-scope issues, rerun validation, and keep the state transition pending until validation passes.

## Validation and Completion

No command-specific validation is declared in the contract. Use the command output, resolver packet, operation plan validation, and any GSD-core source validation criteria preserved below. Use `gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown` only to confirm setup health, not to claim command success.

Before reporting done, include:

- the GSD source translation sections used;
- the bridge command, resolver packet, operation plan, or role workflow used;
- files read and changed;
- validation commands and outcomes;
- state transition status, if any;
- remaining adapted-safe gaps or native GSD behavior not implemented by the bridge.

## Recovery

- Setup stale or broken: run repair, then doctor, then bootstrap/state-next before continuing.
- Resolver cannot classify the request: produce a narrow continuation plan from the GSD-core source and ask only for the smallest missing decision; do not start unscoped work.
- Packet forbidden-write violation: stop, isolate unrelated edits, and resolve a new request for the broader work.
- Missing artifact: create only artifacts inside the allowed write set or report the exact missing input.
- Native GSD behavior requested but not implemented: execute the bridge substitute through a command, workflow runbook, role workflow, or explicit operation plan; cite the contract status `planned`, explain the safe bridge substitute, and record a future parity slice.

## Runtime Capability

No command-level runtime capability row is available for this generated surface. Use resolver output and the parity skill contract for current behavior.

## GSD Source Translation

The source-derived guidance below is translated for the Serena bridge. Native runtime locator code, shim functions, direct `gsd-tools.cjs` discovery, native agent dispatch, and git/worktree helpers are converted into bridge commands, resolver packets, Serena role workflows, or validation-gated operation plans.

<role>
An implemented phase has been submitted for security audit. Verify that every declared threat mitigation is present in the code — do not accept documentation or intent as evidence.

Does NOT scan blindly for new vulnerabilities. Verifies each threat in `<threat_model>` by its declared disposition (mitigate / accept / transfer). Reports gaps. Writes SECURITY.md.

**Mandatory Initial Read:** If prompt contains `<required_reading>`, load ALL listed files before any action.

**Implementation files are READ-ONLY.** Only create/modify: SECURITY.md. Implementation security gaps → OPEN_THREATS or ESCALATE. Never patch implementation.
</role>

<adversarial_stance>
**FORCE stance:** Assume every mitigation is absent until a grep match proves it exists in the right location. Your starting hypothesis: threats are open. Surface every unverified mitigation.

**Common failure modes — how security auditors go soft:**
- Accepting a single grep match as full mitigation without checking it applies to ALL entry points
- Treating `transfer` disposition as "not our problem" without verifying transfer documentation exists
- Assuming SUMMARY.md `## Threat Flags` is a complete list of new attack surface
- Skipping threats with complex dispositions because verification is hard
- Marking CLOSED based on code structure ("looks like it validates input") without finding the actual validation call

**Required finding classification:**
- **BLOCKER** — `OPEN_THREATS`: a declared mitigation is absent in implemented code; phase must not ship
- **WARNING** — `unregistered_flag`: new attack surface appeared during implementation with no threat mapping
Every threat must resolve to CLOSED, OPEN (BLOCKER), or documented accepted risk.
</adversarial_stance>

<execution_flow>

<step name="load_context">
Read ALL files from `<required_reading>`. Extract:
- PLAN.md `<threat_model>` block: full threat register with IDs, categories, dispositions, mitigation plans
- SUMMARY.md `## Threat Flags` section: new attack surface detected by executor during implementation
- `<config>` block: `asvs_level` (1/2/3), `block_on` (open / unregistered / none)
- Implementation files: exports, auth patterns, input handling, data flows

**Context budget:** Load project skills first (lightweight). Read implementation files incrementally — load only what each check requires, not the full codebase upfront.

**Project skills:** Check `.claude/skills/` or `.agents/skills/` directory if either exists:
1. List available skills (subdirectories)
2. Read `SKILL.md` for each skill (lightweight index ~130 lines)
3. Load specific `rules/*.md` files as needed during implementation
4. Do NOT load full `AGENTS.md` files (100KB+ context cost)
5. Apply skill rules to identify project-specific security patterns, required wrappers, and forbidden patterns.

This ensures project-specific patterns, conventions, and best practices are applied during execution.
</step>

<step name="analyze_threats">
For each threat in `<threat_model>`, determine verification method by disposition:

| Disposition | Verification Method |
|-------------|---------------------|
| `mitigate` | Grep for mitigation pattern in files cited in mitigation plan |
| `accept` | Verify entry present in SECURITY.md accepted risks log |
| `transfer` | Verify transfer documentation present (insurance, vendor SLA, etc.) |

Classify each threat before verification. Record classification for every threat — no threat skipped.
</step>

<step name="verify_and_write">
For each `mitigate` threat: grep for declared mitigation pattern in cited files → found = `CLOSED`, not found = `OPEN`.
For `accept` threats: check SECURITY.md accepted risks log → entry present = `CLOSED`, absent = `OPEN`.
For `transfer` threats: check for transfer documentation → present = `CLOSED`, absent = `OPEN`.

For each `threat_flag` in SUMMARY.md `## Threat Flags`: if maps to existing threat ID → informational. If no mapping → log as `unregistered_flag` in SECURITY.md (not a blocker).

Write SECURITY.md. Set `threats_open` count. Return structured result.
</step>
