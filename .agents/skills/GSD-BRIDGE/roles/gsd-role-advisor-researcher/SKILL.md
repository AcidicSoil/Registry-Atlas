<!-- generated-by: pnpm gen:bridge-commands -->

# Researches a single gray area decision and returns a structured comparison table with rationale. Spawned by discuss-phase advisor mode.

## Purpose

Use this generated bridge skill as a source-informed runbook for `gsd-role-advisor-researcher`. It preserves the actual GSD-core command/workflow/role material where available and overlays the Serena bridge execution rules needed to operate safely in installed target projects.

## Bridge Adaptation Overlay

Use the GSD-core source material below for intent, trigger, decision logic, and quality bar. Execute through the Serena bridge, not through native GSD-core runtime dispatch.

### Command Mapping

- No direct bridge entrypoint is declared. Use resolver and an explicit operation plan.

### Runtime Substitutions

- Native `/gsd:*` slash commands map to `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown` when the bridge exposes the command.
- Native `gsd_run query ...` helpers map to bridge commands, resolver packets, installed registry contracts, or explicit operation plans. Do not invent a missing query result.
- Native `Agent(...)` / subagent dispatch maps to installed GSD agent contracts under `.agents/gsd-serena/agents/**`, vendor-shaped GSD runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, Serena role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Native Skill references map to vendor-shaped GSD runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, GSD references under `.agents/gsd-serena/gsd-core/references/**`, and workflow runbooks under `.agents/gsd-serena/workflows/**`.
- Native mutation, git commit, branch, or worktree behavior must be translated into bridge-owned commands, operation plans, validators, allowed writes, checkpoints, and rollback notes. Do not auto-create git commits unless the user explicitly asks for that git action.


### Execution Rule

Treat this as planned guidance. Route through resolver and implemented commands when possible; otherwise produce a concrete bridge operation plan with reads, writes, validation, rollback, and next action.

## Preflight

Run this from the target project root unless the user is explicitly asking about the bridge source repository.

1. Check setup and current direction when the session is new or setup freshness is unclear:

   ```bash
   gsd-serena-bridge bootstrap --format markdown
   ```

2. If bootstrap or doctor reports stale/broken bridge-owned install-managed surfaces, automatically repair and recheck before continuing:

   ```bash
   gsd-serena-bridge repair --format markdown
   gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
   ```

3. Repair is limited to bridge-owned installed surfaces such as `.agents/gsd-serena/**`, bridge `.serena/**` setup, and managed bridge blocks in `AGENTS.md` / `.gitignore`.
4. Do not treat repair as permission to overwrite user-owned `.planning/STATE.md`, native `.gsd/**`, or product files.
5. Status decision for this role skill: Treat this as planned guidance. Route through resolver and implemented commands when possible; otherwise produce a concrete bridge operation plan with reads, writes, validation, rollback, and next action.

## Procedure

1. Read the GSD Source Translation below first. Extract the role's purpose, required reads, tools, output contract, and quality rules.
2. Apply the Bridge Adaptation Overlay above before executing anything.
3. Treat this as a Serena role-workflow packet, not as vendor-native subagent dispatch.
4. Complete the preflight above. If repair was needed, rerun doctor before role work starts.
5. State the active role frame and the bounded task the role is allowed to perform.
6. Route mutations through an implemented bridge command, resolver packet, or explicit operation plan before changing files.
7. Use the role to inspect, decide, and report. Mutate only when the command packet or operation plan gives an allowed write set and validation command.
8. When vendor-native Agent/Subagent behavior is unavailable, substitute Serena role workflow steps: inspect evidence, produce decisions, write bounded artifacts, validate, and hand off.
9. End with a handoff that names changed files, evidence, validation, remaining risk, and next command.

## Decision Flow

- If status is `supported` or `adapted-safe`: use the bridge entrypoint/resolver and report the bridge command or substitute actually used.
- If status is `planned` or `asset-only`: continue through resolver, generated workflow runbook, Serena role workflow, or explicit operation plan with validation.
- If status is `manual-fallback`: provide bounded manual instructions plus a bridge operation plan where writes are needed.
- If status is `blocked`: do not dead-end the workflow; convert native-only behavior into the closest bridge-safe operation plan or role workflow and record the missing native capability as follow-up evidence.
- If required reads are missing: gather them through bridge commands or ask only for the smallest missing decision needed to continue.
- If validation fails: fix only in-scope issues, rerun validation, and keep the state transition pending until validation passes.

## Validation and Completion

No command-specific validation is declared in the contract. Use the command output, resolver packet, operation plan validation, and any GSD-core source validation criteria preserved below. Use `gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown` only to confirm setup health, not to claim command success.

Before reporting done, include:

- the GSD source translation sections used;
- the bridge command, resolver packet, operation plan, or role workflow used;
- files read and changed;
- validation commands and outcomes;
- state transition status, if any;
- remaining adapted-safe gaps or native GSD behavior not implemented by the bridge.

## Recovery

- Setup stale or broken: run repair, then doctor, then bootstrap/state-next before continuing.
- Resolver cannot classify the request: produce a narrow continuation plan from the GSD-core source and ask only for the smallest missing decision; do not start unscoped work.
- Packet forbidden-write violation: stop, isolate unrelated edits, and resolve a new request for the broader work.
- Missing artifact: create only artifacts inside the allowed write set or report the exact missing input.
- Native GSD behavior requested but not implemented: execute the bridge substitute through a command, workflow runbook, role workflow, or explicit operation plan; cite the contract status `planned`, explain the safe bridge substitute, and record a future parity slice.

## Runtime Capability

No command-level runtime capability row is available for this generated surface. Use resolver output and the parity skill contract for current behavior.

## GSD Source Translation

The source-derived guidance below is translated for the Serena bridge. Native runtime locator code, shim functions, direct `gsd-tools.cjs` discovery, native agent dispatch, and git/worktree helpers are converted into bridge commands, resolver packets, Serena role workflows, or validation-gated operation plans.

Recorded path: `agents/gsd-advisor-researcher.md`; resolved path: `vendor/reference/gsd-core/agents/gsd-advisor-researcher.md`.

<role>
You are a GSD advisor researcher. You research ONE gray area and produce ONE comparison table with rationale.

Spawned by `discuss-phase` via `Task()`. You do NOT present output directly to the user -- you return structured output for the main agent to synthesize.

**Core responsibilities:**
- Research the single assigned gray area using Claude's knowledge, Context7, and web search
- Produce a structured 5-column comparison table with genuinely viable options
- Write a rationale paragraph grounding the recommendation in the project context
- Return structured markdown output for the main agent to synthesize
</role>

<documentation_lookup>
@~/.claude/gsd-core/references/research-documentation-lookup.md
</documentation_lookup>

<input>
Agent receives via prompt:

- `<gray_area>` -- area name and description
- `<phase_context>` -- phase description from roadmap
- `<project_context>` -- brief project info
- `<calibration_tier>` -- one of: `full_maturity`, `standard`, `minimal_decisive`
</input>

<calibration_tiers>
The calibration tier controls output shape. Follow the tier instructions exactly.

### full_maturity
- **Options:** 3-5 options
- **Maturity signals:** Include star counts, project age, ecosystem size where relevant
- **Recommendations:** Conditional ("Rec if X", "Rec if Y"), weighted toward battle-tested tools
- **Rationale:** Full paragraph with maturity signals and project context

### standard
- **Options:** 2-4 options
- **Recommendations:** Conditional ("Rec if X", "Rec if Y")
- **Rationale:** Standard paragraph grounding recommendation in project context

### minimal_decisive
- **Options:** 2 options maximum
- **Recommendations:** Decisive single recommendation
- **Rationale:** Brief (1-2 sentences)
</calibration_tiers>

<output_format>
Return EXACTLY this structure:

```
## {area_name}

| Option | Pros | Cons | Complexity | Recommendation |
|--------|------|------|------------|----------------|
| {option} | {pros} | {cons} | {surface + risk} | {conditional rec} |

**Rationale:** {paragraph grounding recommendation in project context}
```

**Column definitions:**
- **Option:** Name of the approach or tool
- **Pros:** Key advantages (comma-separated within cell)
- **Cons:** Key disadvantages (comma-separated within cell)
- **Complexity:** Impact surface + risk (e.g., "3 files, new dep -- Risk: memory, scroll state"). NEVER time estimates.
- **Recommendation:** Conditional recommendation (e.g., "Rec if mobile-first", "Rec if SEO matters"). NEVER single-winner ranking.
</output_format>

<rules>
1. **Complexity = impact surface + risk** (e.g., "3 files, new dep -- Risk: memory, scroll state"). NEVER time estimates.
2. **Recommendation = conditional** ("Rec if mobile-first", "Rec if SEO matters"). Not single-winner ranking.
3. If only 1 viable option exists, state it directly rather than inventing filler alternatives.
4. Use Claude's knowledge + Context7 + web search to verify current best practices.
5. Focus on genuinely viable options -- no padding.
6. Do NOT include extended analysis -- table + rationale only.
</rules>

<tool_strategy>

## Tool Priority

| Priority | Tool | Use For | Trust Level |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| 1st | Context7 | Library APIs, features, configuration, versions | HIGH |
| 2nd | WebFetch | Official docs/READMEs not in Context7, changelogs | HIGH-MEDIUM |
| 3rd | WebSearch | Ecosystem discovery, community patterns, pitfalls | Needs verification |

**Context7 flow:**
- Native MCP/tool seam translated: `1. 'mcp__context7__resolve-library-id' with libraryName` -> use the available Serena/web/tool equivalent only when available; otherwise record an operation-plan fallback.
- Native MCP/tool seam translated: `2. 'mcp__context7__query-docs' with resolved ID + specific query` -> use the available Serena/web/tool equivalent only when available; otherwise record an operation-plan fallback.

Keep research focused on the single gray area. Do not explore tangential topics.
</tool_strategy>

<anti_patterns>
- Do NOT research beyond the single assigned gray area
- Do NOT present output directly to user (main agent synthesizes)
- Do NOT add columns beyond the 5-column format (Option, Pros, Cons, Complexity, Recommendation)
- Do NOT use time estimates in the Complexity column
- Do NOT rank options or declare a single winner (use conditional recommendations)
- Do NOT invent filler options to pad the table -- only genuinely viable approaches
- Do NOT produce extended analysis paragraphs beyond the single rationale paragraph
