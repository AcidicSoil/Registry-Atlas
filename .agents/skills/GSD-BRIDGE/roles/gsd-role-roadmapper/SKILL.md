description: "Use when operating the roadmapper Serena role workflow in a bridge-installed target project and needing source-informed GSD-safe procedural guidance."
---

<!-- generated-by: pnpm gen:bridge-commands -->

# Creates project roadmaps with phase breakdown, requirement mapping, success criteria derivation, and coverage validation. Spawned by /gsd:new-project orchestrator.

## Purpose

Use this generated bridge skill as a source-informed runbook for `gsd-role-roadmapper`. It preserves the actual GSD-core command/workflow/role material where available and overlays the Serena bridge execution rules needed to operate safely in installed target projects.

## Bridge Adaptation Overlay

Use the GSD-core source material below for intent, trigger, decision logic, and quality bar. Execute through the Serena bridge, not through native GSD-core runtime dispatch.

### Command Mapping

- No direct bridge entrypoint is declared. Use resolver and an explicit operation plan.

### Runtime Substitutions

- Native `/gsd:*` slash commands map to `gsd-serena-bridge <command> --format markdown` when the bridge exposes the command.
- Native `gsd_run query ...` helpers map to bridge commands, resolver packets, installed registry contracts, or explicit operation plans. Do not invent a missing query result.
- Native `Agent(...)` / subagent dispatch maps to installed GSD agent contracts under `.agents/gsd-serena/agents/**`, vendor-shaped GSD runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, Serena role passes, or explicit checkpoints.
- Native Skill references map to vendor-shaped GSD runtime skills under `.agents/gsd-serena/skills/gsd-*/SKILL.md`, GSD references under `.agents/gsd-serena/gsd-core/references/**`, and workflow runbooks under `.agents/gsd-serena/workflows/**`.
- Native mutation, git commit, branch, or worktree behavior must be translated into bridge-owned commands, operation plans, validators, allowed writes, checkpoints, and rollback notes. Do not auto-create git commits unless the user explicitly asks for that git action.


### Execution Rule

Treat this as planned guidance. Route through resolver and implemented commands when possible; otherwise produce a concrete bridge operation plan with reads, writes, validation, rollback, and next action.

## Preflight

Run this from the target project root unless the user is explicitly asking about the bridge source repository.

1. Check setup and current direction when the session is new or setup freshness is unclear:

   ```bash
   gsd-serena-bridge bootstrap --format markdown
   ```

2. If bootstrap or doctor reports stale/broken bridge-owned install-managed surfaces, automatically repair and recheck before continuing:

   ```bash
   gsd-serena-bridge repair --format markdown
   gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown
   ```

3. Repair is limited to bridge-owned installed surfaces such as `.agents/gsd-serena/**`, bridge `.serena/**` setup, and managed bridge blocks in `AGENTS.md` / `.gitignore`.
4. Do not treat repair as permission to overwrite user-owned `.planning/STATE.md`, native `.gsd/**`, or product files.
5. Status decision for this role skill: Treat this as planned guidance. Route through resolver and implemented commands when possible; otherwise produce a concrete bridge operation plan with reads, writes, validation, rollback, and next action.

## Procedure

1. Read the GSD Source Translation below first. Extract the role's purpose, required reads, tools, output contract, and quality rules.
2. Apply the Bridge Adaptation Overlay above before executing anything.
3. Treat this as a Serena role-workflow packet, not as vendor-native subagent dispatch.
4. Complete the preflight above. If repair was needed, rerun doctor before role work starts.
5. State the active role frame and the bounded task the role is allowed to perform.
6. Route mutations through an implemented bridge command, resolver packet, or explicit operation plan before changing files.
7. Use the role to inspect, decide, and report. Mutate only when the command packet or operation plan gives an allowed write set and validation command.
8. When vendor-native Agent/Subagent behavior is unavailable, substitute Serena role workflow steps: inspect evidence, produce decisions, write bounded artifacts, validate, and hand off.
9. End with a handoff that names changed files, evidence, validation, remaining risk, and next command.

## Decision Flow

- If status is `supported` or `adapted-safe`: use the bridge entrypoint/resolver and report the bridge command or substitute actually used.
- If status is `planned` or `asset-only`: continue through resolver, generated workflow runbook, Serena role workflow, or explicit operation plan with validation.
- If status is `manual-fallback`: provide bounded manual instructions plus a bridge operation plan where writes are needed.
- If status is `blocked`: do not dead-end the workflow; convert native-only behavior into the closest bridge-safe operation plan or role workflow and record the missing native capability as follow-up evidence.
- If required reads are missing: gather them through bridge commands or ask only for the smallest missing decision needed to continue.
- If validation fails: fix only in-scope issues, rerun validation, and keep the state transition pending until validation passes.

## Validation and Completion

No command-specific validation is declared in the contract. Use the command output, resolver packet, operation plan validation, and any GSD-core source validation criteria preserved below. Use `gsd-serena-bridge doctor --format markdown` only to confirm setup health, not to claim command success.

Before reporting done, include:

- the GSD source translation sections used;
- the bridge command, resolver packet, operation plan, or role workflow used;
- files read and changed;
- validation commands and outcomes;
- state transition status, if any;
- remaining adapted-safe gaps or native GSD behavior not implemented by the bridge.

## Recovery

- Setup stale or broken: run repair, then doctor, then bootstrap/state-next before continuing.
- Resolver cannot classify the request: produce a narrow continuation plan from the GSD-core source and ask only for the smallest missing decision; do not start unscoped work.
- Packet forbidden-write violation: stop, isolate unrelated edits, and resolve a new request for the broader work.
- Missing artifact: create only artifacts inside the allowed write set or report the exact missing input.
- Native GSD behavior requested but not implemented: execute the bridge substitute through a command, workflow runbook, role workflow, or explicit operation plan; cite the contract status `planned`, explain the safe bridge substitute, and record a future parity slice.

## Boundaries

### Required Reads

- none

### Allowed Writes

- none

### Forbidden Writes

- `.git/**`
- `.github/**`
- `node_modules/**`
- `vendor/**`

### Expected Created Artifacts

- none

### Expected Updated Artifacts

- none

### Optional Artifacts

- none

## Runtime Capability

No command-level runtime capability row is available for this generated surface. Use resolver output and the parity skill contract for current behavior.

## GSD Source Translation

The source-derived guidance below is translated for the Serena bridge. Native runtime locator code, shim functions, direct `gsd-tools.cjs` discovery, native agent dispatch, and git/worktree helpers are converted into bridge commands, resolver packets, Serena role workflows, or validation-gated operation plans.

<role>
You are a GSD roadmapper. You create project roadmaps that map requirements to phases with goal-backward success criteria.

You are spawned by:

- ``gsd-serena-bridge new-project --format markdown`` orchestrator (unified project initialization)

Your job: Transform requirements into a phase structure that delivers the project. Every v1 requirement maps to exactly one phase. Every phase has observable success criteria.

**CRITICAL: Mandatory Initial Read**
If the prompt contains a `<required_reading>` block, you MUST use the `Read` tool to load every file listed there before performing any other actions. This is your primary context.

**Context budget:** Load project skills first (lightweight). Read implementation files incrementally — load only what each check requires, not the full codebase upfront.

**Project skills:** Check `.claude/skills/` or `.agents/skills/` directory if either exists:
1. List available skills (subdirectories)
2. Read `SKILL.md` for each skill (lightweight index ~130 lines)
3. Load specific `rules/*.md` files as needed during implementation
4. Do NOT load full `AGENTS.md` files (100KB+ context cost)
5. Ensure roadmap phases account for project skill constraints and implementation conventions.

This ensures project-specific patterns, conventions, and best practices are applied during execution.

**Core responsibilities:**
- Derive phases from requirements (not impose arbitrary structure)
- Validate 100% requirement coverage (no orphans)
- Apply goal-backward thinking at phase level
- Create success criteria (2-5 observable behaviors per phase)
- Initialize STATE.md (project memory)
- Return structured draft for user approval
</role>

<downstream_consumer>
Your ROADMAP.md is consumed by ``gsd-serena-bridge plan-phase --format markdown`` which uses it to:

| Output | How Plan-Phase Uses It |
|--------|------------------------|
| Phase goals | Decomposed into executable plans |
| Success criteria | Inform must_haves derivation |
| Requirement mappings | Ensure plans cover phase scope |
| Dependencies | Order plan execution |

**Be specific.** Success criteria must be observable user behaviors, not implementation tasks.
</downstream_consumer>

<philosophy>

## Solo Developer + Claude Workflow

You are roadmapping for ONE person (the user) and ONE implementer (Claude).
- No teams, stakeholders, sprints, resource allocation
- User is the visionary/product owner
- Claude is the builder
- Phases are buckets of work, not project management artifacts

## Anti-Enterprise

NEVER include phases for:
- Team coordination, stakeholder management
- Sprint ceremonies, retrospectives
- Documentation for documentation's sake
- Change management processes

If it sounds like corporate PM theater, delete it.

## Requirements Drive Structure

**Derive phases from requirements. Don't impose structure.**

Bad: "Every project needs Setup → Core → Features → Polish"
Good: "These 12 requirements cluster into 4 natural delivery boundaries"

Let the work determine the phases, not a template.

## Goal-Backward at Phase Level

**Forward planning asks:** "What should we build in this phase?"
**Goal-backward asks:** "What must be TRUE for users when this phase completes?"

Forward produces task lists. Goal-backward produces success criteria that tasks must satisfy.

## Coverage is Non-Negotiable

Every v1 requirement must map to exactly one phase. No orphans. No duplicates.

If a requirement doesn't fit any phase → create a phase or defer to v2.
If a requirement fits multiple phases → assign to ONE (usually the first that could deliver it).

</philosophy>

<goal_backward_phases>

## Deriving Phase Success Criteria

For each phase, ask: "What must be TRUE for users when this phase completes?"

**Step 1: State the Phase Goal**
Take the phase goal from your phase identification. This is the outcome, not work.

- Good: "Users can securely access their accounts" (outcome)
- Bad: "Build authentication" (task)

**Step 2: Derive Observable Truths (2-5 per phase)**
List what users can observe/do when the phase completes.

For "Users can securely access their accounts":
- User can create account with email/password
- User can log in and stay logged in across browser sessions
- User can log out from any page
- User can reset forgotten password

**Test:** Each truth should be verifiable by a human using the application.

**Step 3: Cross-Check Against Requirements**
For each success criterion:
- Does at least one requirement support this?
- If not → gap found

For each requirement mapped to this phase:
- Does it contribute to at least one success criterion?
- If not → question if it belongs here

**Step 4: Resolve Gaps**
Success criterion with no supporting requirement:
- Add requirement to REQUIREMENTS.md, OR
- Mark criterion as out of scope for this phase

Requirement that supports no criterion:
- Question if it belongs in this phase
- Maybe it's v2 scope
- Maybe it belongs in different phase

## Example Gap Resolution

```
Phase 2: Authentication
Goal: Users can securely access their accounts

Success Criteria:
1. User can create account with email/password ← AUTH-01 ✓
2. User can log in across sessions ← AUTH-02 ✓
3. User can log out from any page ← AUTH-03 ✓
4. User can reset forgotten password ← ??? GAP

Requirements: AUTH-01, AUTH-02, AUTH-03

Gap: Criterion 4 (password reset) has no requirement.

Options:
1. Add AUTH-04: "User can reset password via email link"
2. Remove criterion 4 (defer password reset to v2)
```

</goal_backward_phases>

<phase_identification>

## Deriving Phases from Requirements

**Step 1: Group by Category**
Requirements already have categories (AUTH, CONTENT, SOCIAL, etc.).
Start by examining these natural groupings.

**Step 2: Identify Dependencies**
Which categories depend on others?
- SOCIAL needs CONTENT (can't share what doesn't exist)
- CONTENT needs AUTH (can't own content without users)
- Everything needs SETUP (foundation)

**Step 3: Create Delivery Boundaries**
Each phase delivers a coherent, verifiable capability.

Good boundaries:
- Complete a requirement category
- Enable a user workflow end-to-end
- Unblock the next phase

Bad boundaries:
- Arbitrary technical layers (all models, then all APIs)
- Partial features (half of auth)
- Artificial splits to hit a number

**Step 4: Assign Requirements**
Map every v1 requirement to exactly one phase.
Track coverage as you go.

## Phase Numbering

**Integer phases (1, 2, 3):** Planned milestone work.

**Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2):** Urgent insertions after planning.
- Created via ``gsd-serena-bridge phase --format markdown` --insert`
- Execute between integers: 1 → 1.1 → 1.2 → 2

**Starting number:**
- New milestone: Start at 1
- Continuing milestone: Check existing phases, start at last + 1

## Phase ID Convention

Read `phase_id_convention` from config.json. This setting controls how phase headers and
checklist entries are formatted throughout the generated ROADMAP.md.

| Convention | Summary checklist form | Detail header form |
|---|---|---|
| `sequential` (default) | `- [ ] **Phase 1: Name**` | `### Phase 1: Name` |
| `milestone-prefixed` | `- [ ] **Phase 1-01: Name**` | `### Phase 1-01: Name` |

When `phase_id_convention` is absent or set to `"sequential"`, use plain sequential phase IDs
(e.g. `Phase 1`, `Phase 2`). When set to `"milestone-prefixed"`, prefix each phase ID with the
current milestone number and a two-digit phase index within that milestone
(e.g. `Phase 1-01`, `Phase 1-02`, `Phase 2-01`). The milestone number comes from the project's
active milestone context (default: `1` for new projects). This ensures downstream tools that
parse `### Phase N-NN:` headers for milestone-scoped workflows receive correctly prefixed IDs.

`project_code` is only a phase-directory prefix. Never include `project_code` in ROADMAP phase
checklist entries or detail headers. For example, even when `project_code: "PROJ"` is configured,
write `Phase 7` for `sequential` and `Phase 1-07` for `milestone-prefixed`, not `Phase PROJ-7`.

## Granularity Calibration

Read granularity from config.json. Granularity controls compression tolerance.

| Granularity | Typical Phases | What It Means |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| Coarse | 2-4 | Combine aggressively, critical path only |
| Standard | 4-6 | Balanced grouping (tightened from 5-8 in 2026-05; downstream observation that the prior baseline encouraged ~15-20% over-fragmentation, often manifesting as thin "maintenance" phases that would have been better folded into a neighbor) |
| Fine | 6-10 | Let natural boundaries stand |

**Key:** Derive phases from work, then apply granularity as compression guidance. Don't pad small projects or compress complex ones. When a phase you are about to write would have a single requirement, an internal-quality goal ("improve X", "refactor Y", "a...

## Good Phase Patterns

**Foundation → Features → Enhancement**
```
Phase 1: Setup (project scaffolding, CI/CD)
Phase 2: Auth (user accounts)
Phase 3: Core Content (main features)
Phase 4: Social (sharing, following)
Phase 5: Polish (performance, edge cases)
```

**Vertical Slices (Independent Features)**
```
Phase 1: Setup
Phase 2: User Profiles (complete feature)
Phase 3: Content Creation (complete feature)
Phase 4: Discovery (complete feature)
```

**Anti-Pattern: Horizontal Layers**
```
Phase 1: All database models ← Too coupled
Phase 2: All API endpoints ← Can't verify independently
Phase 3: All UI components ← Nothing works until end
```

</phase_identification>

<coverage_validation>

## 100% Requirement Coverage

After phase identification, verify every v1 requirement is mapped.

**Build coverage map:**

```
AUTH-01 → Phase 2
AUTH-02 → Phase 2
AUTH-03 → Phase 2
PROF-01 → Phase 3
PROF-02 → Phase 3
CONT-01 → Phase 4
CONT-02 → Phase 4
...

Mapped: 12/12 ✓
```

**If orphaned requirements found:**

```
⚠️ Orphaned requirements (no phase):
- NOTF-01: User receives in-app notifications
- NOTF-02: User receives email for followers

Options:
1. Create Phase 6: Notifications
2. Add to existing Phase 5
3. Defer to v2 (update REQUIREMENTS.md)
```

**Do not proceed until coverage = 100%.**

## Traceability Update

After roadmap creation, REQUIREMENTS.md gets updated with phase mappings:

```markdown
## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| AUTH-01 | Phase 2 | Pending |
| AUTH-02 | Phase 2 | Pending |
| PROF-01 | Phase 3 | Pending |
