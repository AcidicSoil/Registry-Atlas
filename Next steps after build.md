What's my next step after pnpm dev, preview, and build all pass for this project?

1.  Deploy the production output: publish the `dist/` directory generated by `pnpm build` (`tsc && vite build`).
    
    package
    
2.  Add CI to enforce it: on every PR/main push, run `pnpm install` + `pnpm build` (optionally store `dist/` as an artifact).
    
    package
    
3.  Cut a release once deployed: bump off `0.0.0`, tag, and publish notes.
    
    package

best place to do all of that?

GitHub: repo + Actions (CI) + Pages (deploy `dist/`) + Releases (tags/changelog) in one system. This project is a static Vite build (`tsc && vite build`) that outputs a deployable `dist/`, so Pages fits cleanly.

## You asked:

so github pages ? will suffice ?

Yes. GitHub Pages is sufficient for this project because it’s a static Vite build (`tsc && vite build`) that outputs `dist/`. [vitejs](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy)

Do this:

1.  Set Vite `base` correctly for Pages:
    

*   Project site `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` → `base: '/<repo>/'`
    
*   User/Org site `https://<user>.github.io/` → `base: '/'` [vitejs](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy)
    

2.  Repo Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions** [vitejs](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy)
    
3.  Add `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (pnpm version of Vite’s Pages workflow):
    

    name: Deploy static content to Pages
    
    on:
      push:
        branches: ['main']
      workflow_dispatch:
    
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    
    concurrency:
      group: 'pages'
      cancel-in-progress: true
    
    jobs:
      deploy:
        environment:
          name: github-pages
          url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v5
          - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
            with:
              version: 9
          - uses: actions/setup-node@v6
            with:
              node-version: lts/*
              cache: 'pnpm'
          - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
          - run: pnpm build
          - uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
          - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4
            with:
              path: './dist'
          - id: deployment
            uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
    

(Uses GitHub’s official Pages artifact + deploy actions.) [vitejs+2GitHub+2](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy)
