			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Foundation: Schema Definition and Style Extraction",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed. The task is straightforward: define TypeScript interfaces based on the PRD and move CSS from a <style> block to a .css file.",
			"reasoning": "This is a preparatory task. Defining TypeScript interfaces is low effort. Extracting CSS is copy-paste work with verification, assuming no complex CSS pre-processing is currently set up. The codebase analysis shows a flat structure, making this simple."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Data Layer: Registry Dataset Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed. Create a static data file matching the schema defined in Task 1.",
			"reasoning": "This involves creating a single TypeScript file and populating it with static JSON-like data. It is a data entry and typing exercise with minimal logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Core: Helper Modules for Labels and Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed. Implement simple mapping functions and constant arrays.",
			"reasoning": "These are simple utility functions (switch statements or object lookups) and configuration constants. Very low technical risk."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Core Logic: Grouping and Metrics Algorithms",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of core logic algorithms. 1. Implement search and filtering logic (fuzzy match, case-insensitive). 2. Implement 'By Focus' grouping logic. 3. Implement 'By Component' grouping logic. 4. Implement Matrix view row generation and coverage calculation.",
			"reasoning": "This contains the business logic 'brain' of the application. Implementing robust multi-faceted filtering (search text + tags) and transforming flat data into three different structural representations (Focus groups, Component groups, Matrix rows) requires careful handling of edge cases and efficient array manipulation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "UI Layer: Focus View Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the UI implementation for the Focus View. 1. Create the Sidebar renderer for Focus groups (with active state handling). 2. Create the Card Grid renderer for the main content area. 3. Implement the DOM updates for switching between groups.",
			"reasoning": "Since this is likely a Vanilla JS implementation (based on the lack of framework mentions in the prompt), manual DOM construction and manipulation increases complexity. Ensuring the UI matches the extracted CSS classes precisely adds effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "UI Layer: Component and Matrix View Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the UI implementation for Component and Matrix Views. 1. Implement Component View sidebar and content rendering (similar to Focus view). 2. Implement the Matrix View specific sidebar (legend). 3. Implement the Matrix Table rendering, handling dynamic columns and scrolling.",
			"reasoning": "The Matrix view is more complex than a standard list. It requires rendering a grid/table structure that aligns rows and columns correctly, likely handling overflow/scrolling behavior which can be tricky in Vanilla JS/CSS."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Shell: State Management and Orchestration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the application shell and state management. 1. Define the State interface and initial state. 2. Implement the State Store / Event Emitter pattern to handle updates. 3. Implement the main 'render' loop that diffs state or clears/repaints views. 4. Wire up global event listeners (navigation, search inputs) to trigger state changes.",
			"reasoning": "This is the 'controller' of the application. It needs to manage the flow of data between the logic layer and multiple UI views. Handling state changes (like switching tabs while maintaining search queries) and ensuring the DOM updates efficiently (without full page reloads) in a custom Vanilla JS architecture is complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Integration: Entry Point and Legacy Fallback",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate the integration work. 1. Set up the new entry point script and DOM mounting logic. 2. Refactor the existing index.html to support the dual mode (legacy backup vs new module loading).",
			"reasoning": "Integration requires careful file handling to not break the existing site. Refactoring `index.html` to strip inline code while keeping the structure requires precision, but the logic itself is standard glue code."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Quality Assurance: Unit Tests for Core Logic",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed. Write standard unit tests for the pure functions developed in Task 4.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity here is tied to Task 4. Since Task 4 functions are pure, testing them is straightforward (input -> output). The score reflects the effort to cover edge cases, but technically it is standard."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Documentation and Accessibility",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed. Write documentation and perform a basic a11y audit.",
			"reasoning": "Writing markdown documentation is low complexity. The accessibility audit might reveal issues requiring code changes, but the task definition primarily frames this as a review and documentation step."
