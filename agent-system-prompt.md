For each community registry accessed via the 'View' buttons:

1.  **Wait for Load**: Allow **5-10 seconds** for the website to fully load and hydrate before analyzing the page content.
2.  **First Glance Filter**: After the grace period, scan for a **"Components"** link or button (or clear equivalents like "UI Elements" or "Primitives").
3.  **Skip Condition**: If you do not see a clear **"Components"** link, **SKIP this registry immediately**. Do not navigate deeper or explore "Get Started" unless it's the only path to a visible component sidebar. Do not waste time on sites purely for "Blocks" or "Templates".
4.  **Navigate & Record**: If the filter passes, click the link, record the specific URL, and provide a generalized overview of the specific components found.
5.  **Format**: Use markdown headers and concise bullet points for your report.

Goal: Efficiently catalogue *component libraries*. Speed is key, but allow sites to load first. If it's not obvious after loading, skip it.
